This means that producers are responsible for the collection, recycling, and disposal of their packaging materials, incentivizing them to design more sustainable and eco-friendly packaging solutions. EPR aims to reduce environmental impact and promote a circular economy by shifting the cost and responsibility of waste management from taxpayers to producers.',

A large percentage of EPR legislation includes requirements for identified producers to join a producer responsibility organization (PRO)‚Äîoften an industry-led nonprofit focused on working collectively to meet targets, collect and allocate fees, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of EPR is nothing new; the system has been explored and trialed since the early 1990s, with the first system launching in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/the-evolution-of-germanys-packaging-waste-laws"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Germany in 1991</span></a>.

The map below is a high-level overview of the nations with an active EPR system for managing packaging waste and externalities. As indicated by the map, 63 countries (~32% of the world) currently have some form of EPR system in place in relation to packaging life-cycle management‚Äîwith EPR reaching all continents but Antartica.</p><p>Included in this article are the nations we have identified as having a mandatory Extended Producer for Responsibility system for managing packaging waste and externalities. It is important to note that this is a work in progress as new developments in the EPR space are emerging daily. We are also monitoring the following nations and their developing EPR programs: Argentina, Ghana, Tunisia, Thailand, Malaysia, Israel, and more.

A large percentage of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation includes requirements for identified producers to join a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO)‚Äîoften an industry led non-profit focused on working collectively to meet targets, collect and allocate fees, and more. \n',

The Oregon law focuses on prohibiting PFAS use in foodware containers. The Oregon state legislature defines ‚Äúfoodware container‚Äù as bowls, cups, lids, clamshells, and other takeout packaging for prepared foods. Unlike other bills, Oregon‚Äôs does not mention a particular focus on paper- and fiber-based packaging, instead focusing on food containers as a whole.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: left">Maine&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: left">The state of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/32/title32sec1733.html">Maine</a>&nbsp;is set to ban products and packaging sold or distributed in Maine that are created with intentionally added PFAS. The law is to take effect January 1, 2030‚Äîa far longer timeline than many other states above. The Maine law also contains an exemption for manufacturers that have less than $1,000,000 USD in total annual sales nationally, meaning the bill will not fully phase out PFAS in food packaging in the state.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-bold">How to Prepare for PFAS Regulations&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: left">As highlighted above, 12 US states have already developed regulations to ban PFAS in food packaging and other industries, with 4 of the 12 states operating under live laws.

      '<p>As more consumers skip the trip to the convenience store and opt instead to purchase products online, the focus of packaging is less on selling the good (though that is still a major aspect), and more on safely delivering it to its end destination. The eCommerce trend is hardly that anymore, but rather a fast growing method of purchasing and obtaining goods.</p><p>Historically, product packaging was designed to sell on the shelf. However, with the necessity of eCommerce, traditional brands are having to rethink the way they originally packaged their goods. eCommerce sales are anticipated to rise from $1.3 trillion in 2014 to $4.5 trillion in 2021. That’s an increase of 246.15% If you’re thinking, “What can my company do to capitalize on this eCommerce epidemic?”—don’t worry, we will provide you with some key considerations and takeaways to help get you started or improve your existing efforts.</p><p>Opening the package is one of the obvious issues that affect the eCommerce experience for the consumer. To combat the negative opening experience, Amazon embraces frustration free packaging. This packaging is 100% recyclable and has no need for additional shipping boxes. In just one year, the company was able to eliminate 55,000 tons of excess packaging. With eCommerce, you can break all the retail rules. eCommerce packaging is made directly for consumers while retail packaging is designed for display and presentation.</p><p>Brands are used to shipping product in bulk, pallet-size shipments from plant to brick-and-mortar stores. With eCommerce, they skip the retailer and go straight to the consumer, meaning they must figure out how to ship efficiently in smaller numbers. Getting the package to the consumer without excess waste of box material and dunnage is a major issue to overcome. Many brands have had little time to focus on this because they are just trying to keep up with the growing demand. But environmental issues like reducing landfill waste are a huge concern, especially with millennials who are not afraid to post pictures of packaging like the one shown above. There is no need for this kind of packaging, and companies must do a better job of evaluating their distribution system if they are to stay relevant in the eCommerce market.</p><p>Parcel services make the rules for shipping and they realize the lucrative business that is eCommerce. Recent changes made shipping by overall weight obsolete and instead, shipping prices are now calculated by dimensional weight, often referred to as DIM weight. So, unless your package is optimized to use all available space in a delivery truck, you are paying to ship air. Containers with unused volume space will eat into a company’s profit margins. This is a huge area where companies can take the initiative and begin designing packaging specifically for eCommerce.</p><p>Companies like The Honest Company are also rethinking the products themselves. After your first order of cleaning supplies, you have the option to order refill cleaner instead of a whole new bottle with a sprayer. This not only prevents a sprayer from going to the landfills, but it also allows for smaller and lighter shipping boxes. A lighter, smaller box equals less fuel consumption and less trucks on the road. Spray bottles can be a challenge to ship, so this also reduces the number of products that are likely to be damaged during shipping. The loss of profit due to shipment damage is a factor that can no longer be ignored as eCommerce continues to grow.</p><p>A new term, devicification, has been invented to describe the strategy of engineering products to include a durable structure that the consumer keeps at home and is refilled with a more shippable product. As technology advances, the device will order the refill product, so that it arrives before you ever run out. This strategy will increase profit, as less damage should be incurred during shipping, and help ensure brand loyalty.</p><p>eCommerce packaging works outside of the normal packaging thought sequence. Usually, half the battle in a retail store is getting the consumer to pick up your package, but this is not the case with purchasing online. The first moment of truth with packaging for the consumer is now in the home rather than in the store. Because the landscape is still evolving, companies have incredible opportunities to shape the way this emerging business will unfold.</p>',

      '<p>Let’s start with this question . . . How will you <strong>design for </strong>carbon neutrality? Achieving a net carbon dioxide output as close to zero as possible is accomplished a variety of ways. You can purchase carbon offsets. You can use post consumer recycled materials. You can use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/high-tech-solutions-for-the-net-zero-equation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> You can right-size your shipments, reduce travel time, and use green energy throughout the supply chain.<a href="https://library.packagingschool.com/lessons/Retrieved%20from%20https://route.com/blog/carbon-neutral-shipping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a> Thankfully, tools in the industry exist to help provide reliable and high-quality life-cycle carbon footprint assessments for all of the stages of a package life cycle.&nbsp;</p><p>So, check out these tools that are developed for the packaging industry:</p><ul><li>CleanMetrics<a href="https://www.cleanmetrics.com/html/packaging_carbon_footprints.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a></li><li>Compass by Trayak<a href="https://trayak.com/solutions/ecoimpact-compass-for-packaging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a></li><li>ASSETTM by Amcor<a href="https://www.amcor.com/products/services/life-cycle-assessment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a></li></ul><p>In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (or EPA) also has a carbon calculator that shows how to get on the right track in assessing the shipping-related carbon a business is emitting.<a href="https://www.amcor.com/products/services/life-cycle-assessment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a>,<a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>So, how much carbon is really in a corrugated container?</p><p><div><image src=\'https://packschool.s3.amazonaws.com/lessons/carbon-neutral-part-2/box2.webp\' alt=\'Packaging School\' /></div></p><p>A common e-commerce box like this (9 x 9 x 9 in., weighing 0.64 lbs) is estimated to emit 0.27 kg CO2e / kg.<a href="https://consumerecology.com/carbon-footprint-of-a-cardboard-box/#:~:text=The%20cradle%20to%20grave%20carbon%20footprint%20of%20flat%20cardboard%20is,of%20a%20gallon%20of%20gasoline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>But if you want to calculate your own shipment box, that’s an option too! Companies have calculators based on the various studies they have conducted, like life cycle assessments that you can see right here and learn yourself.<a href="https://www.corrugated.org/carbon-footprint-calculator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>EcoEnclose also has a useful calculator based on weight and number of orders shipped to location per week.<a href="https://www.ecoenclose.com/eco-savings-calculator-corrugated-shipping-boxes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>10</sup></a> So, as you play around with these calculators, you’ll see they will provide you with slightly different data, since the backend systems were designed differently, so, keep this in mind—there’s really not a one-size-fits-all answer until you create it for yourself. The answer to calculating your CO2 is going to be you.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s move on to some different materials—glass and plastic. As you can tell by holding these materials, a glass bottle is heavier than a plastic one, but what impact does that make on the carbon production? Published research out there indicates that glass like this, around 82 grams of PCR (post-consumer recycled) glass, is equivalent to around 250 grams of CO2 equivalents per jar.<a href="https://www.drugplastics.com/choose-plastic-over-glass-for-better-sustainability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>And a lighter version, like at 13 grams of HDPE for instance, you’re going to be looking at around 50 grams of CO2 equivalents.<a href="https://www.drugplastics.com/choose-plastic-over-glass-for-better-sustainability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>11</sup></a> So, simply put, there is 20% less carbon impact for the plastic jar. And let that sit with you for a bit. A lot of these metrics are simply based on weight.</p><p>Now, let’s take a closer look at the difference between recycled PET (rPET) and virgin materials. So, published research has documented PET really well. Let’s say that this is 100% virgin PET, and this is 100% PCR PET. That means it’s 100% post-consumer recycled content. This one, the virgin PET, has an impact of 2.15 kg.<a href="https://packagingeurope.com/study-confirms-the-excellent-carbon-footprint-of-recycled-pet/1923.article" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>12</sup></a> And this one, the exact same thing just in PCR, has an impact of 0.45 kg CO2e.<a href="https://packagingeurope.com/study-confirms-the-excellent-carbon-footprint-of-recycled-pet/1923.article" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>12</sup></a> So, big difference when you look at post-consumer recycled content and its impact on your carbon emissions.</p><p>Overall, PCR packaging allows for a 60% decrease in your carbon footprint compared to virgin plastics.<a href="https://www.copiousbags.com/pcr-post-consumer-recycled-packaging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>13</sup></a> 100% PCR packaging requires no “virgin” petroleum to be sourced and it diverts recycled materials from ending up in a landfill.<a href="https://www.copiousbags.com/pcr-post-consumer-recycled-packaging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>13</sup></a>,<a href="https://www.seventhgeneration.com/blog/all-about-pcr-post-consumer-recycled-material" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>14</sup></a> For example, as part of Colgate-Palmolive’s company commitment to provide “environmentally friendly” home-care products, they relaunched their new Palmolive Ultra dish soap using post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic bottles.<a href="https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/colgate-palmolive-dish-soap-pcr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>15</sup></a> And the company claims this offsets 5,200 tons of plastic a year from ending up in landfills from across the U.S. and Canada.<a href="https://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/colgate-palmolive-dish-soap-pcr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>You may have heard of “net carbon negative”—and some businesses actually have this as a goal.</p><p>IKEA claims to be on track to become climate positive by 2030. And that means, they are going to somehow reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than their entire value chain emits. In order to achieve this, they are looking to promote sustainable choices and transform into a circular business, phase out fossil fuels and work towards 100% renewable energy, and use sustainable materials and food ingredients.<a href="https://about.ikea.com/en/sustainability/becoming-climate-positive/what-is-climate-positive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>While packaging may only represent 5% of a product’s carbon footprint, brands and buyers are looking to find ways to reduce every single percentage point possible.<a href="https://www.climatecollaborative.com/packaging#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20packaging%20accounts%20for,to%20ship%20it%20to%20market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>19</sup></a> This is just one of many skills that a packaging professional can bring to a business. People look to you as a resource for new ideas, innovations, and solutions. Being able to discuss how carbon is measured, show examples of projects that offset emissions, and present opportunities and alternative solutions to reduce carbon, positions you as a packaging consultant and leader.</p><p>Are you ready to join them?</p>',

You might be surprised to hear that we recently had a high school student go through the workshop, creating their own cereal box and taking away valuable insights related to the packaging development process.</p><p>Students, like Claire, go through a 6-phase syllabus that include the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Welcome&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Market Research&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Brainstorm and Ideation&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Design Factors&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Digital Prototype&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Conclusion</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the 6 six phases listed above, students will achieve the following objectives:</p><ul><li><p>Research competitive packaging within a specific market&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Develop a process for ideation and experimentation&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Understand and apply design best practices through prototyping&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Digitally develop a final rendering of the prototype</p></li></ul><p>The interactive online program, completed at one’s own pace, is one-of-a-kind as it takes learning a step further—allowing students to apply the learnings from the course to make a cereal box they design themselves (course instructions may be modified to design any type of box). Pack Design Workshop students create products that combine market research and consumer psychology, graphic design principles, and more. See Claire’s output below:</p><img src="https://psadmin.s3.amazonaws.com/packdesignfront.png"><img src="https://psadmin.s3.amazonaws.com/packdesignback.png"><p>The program allows students with less graphic design and packaging experience, like Claire, to understand the complexities and challenges involved with bringing a new packaging system to market.&nbsp;</p><p>Designers, especially packaging designers, have hundreds of ideas running through their minds daily, so this course can help turn those ideas into tangible end-products and weed out ineffective ideas that are not suitable for execution. For example, Claire told us she has countless designs and ideas that she developed in her spare time, and completing the workshop allowed her to both capitalize on solid concepts and gain an understanding of how to evaluate ideas moving forward.</p><p>An idea for a revolutionary packaging design and system is nothing without a concrete understanding of the steps needed to take such an idea to market, in an effective and un-costly manner. Students learn that packaging design is more than meets the eye—it requires extensive brainstorming, market research, comfortability with software and prototyping, and more.</p><blockquote><p>Claire explains:&nbsp;</p><p>“I am so thankful for this experience. I feel I was able to effectively get my ideas out and onto a professional final product. I learned so much, all the way from psychology in colors, to learning about BoxItNow software. Having the final product is so relieving, but I am still inspired to create more. I have many more designs I have created with my spare time, as this project has opened up so many ideas to me.”</p></blockquote><p>Since Pack Design Workshop allows students to learn at their own pace and potentially bring real-world projects to the table, the possibilities are endless. Ultimately, it will enable you to become a packaging problem solver for your organization and leave you with intangible skills and an end-product.<br></p><p>Turn your ideas into reality with Pack Design Workshop!&nbsp;Learn more at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://library.packagingschool.com/packdesign-workshop">https://library.packagingschool.com/packdesign-workshop</a></p>',

As a company of individuals committed to bettering the lives of those we come in contact with, we believe in the power of education to transform and elevate humans not only in their professional careers, but also as global citizens on this planet. Right now, we sit at around 8,000 learners from all over the world who have chosen to invest their time and resources on our learning platform—knowledge seekers entrusting us with their career advancement. That fact makes us simultaneously proud and humble.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>A Cooperative Effort</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">One of the certificate programs we offer is<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://packagingschool.com/get-to-know-cmpm/">The Certificate of Mastery in Packaging Management</a> run in conjunction with the<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/thinkclemson/index.html">Clemson Center for Corporate Learning</a>.<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>This interactive teaching series guides organization leaders through a process of designing effective packaging systems.<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>Students utilize their creativity, actualize cost-savings for their company, and develop complete packaging systems during the twelve-week course. Ten online courses and a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/cmpm-features-exploring-our-packaging-development-plan-pdp">packaging development plan</a> (PDP)—which applies the teachings of the coursework to a current project—work hand-in-hand to create a superb learning experience. All lessons are on-demand, so students can log in and learn at the time that best suits their schedule. You pay $7,000 for 80 hours of content, 10 courses, and 8 CEUs—and payment plans are available. As a bonus, this program is monitored by a knowledgeable PhD who is available for questions and calls.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Don’t Just Take Our Word for It</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">So, you have heard from us about how fantastic this program is, but we think you might want an unbiased opinion as well. Something many learners tell us they appreciate about our programs is their flexibility. We understand that many of you have very full lives with family, work, and extracurricular activities that keep you busy. One learner said, “The flexibility to do my own schedule was awesome because I was able to look at what sections there were for the week, and then I would schedule out my week ahead of time based on my availability and what was required.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Designed with You in Mind</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">A strategy that ties into the need for flexibility is the way we choose to structure the individual lessons. We design most of our content as micro-lessons which enhance the adaptability of the program to the student’s needs. Micro-lessons are typically eight to ten minutes in length, offering the learner the advantage of concise and to the point information that can be fit into small breaks throughout the day. Of course, sitting down and catching up for a few hours at a time is an option too, but not all of us have that disposable time in large chunks. Speaking to this point, a learner noted, “I really liked the micro-lessons you laid out. In the past, going to lectures for hours and hours, that didn’t work well for me. So, I really appreciate the classes where you could dive in for ten to fifteen minutes—really focus on those micro-lessons, and that was excellent.”</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Packaging is Everywhere</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">The packaging industry is vast. There are multiple facets to the field, and most people study and are proficient in their specific cog of the wheel without much knowledge of what goes on to make the industry function as a whole. Our CMPM program tackles that issue to give you a broader, holistic view of packaging. Two different students said they appreciated this aspect of our program: “I didn’t study packaging design . . . but I got a really good overview of what it takes to create packaging from start to finish,” and “I studied industrial engineering . . . I think the certificate exists to get a more detailed view on the supply chain because you lose your focus . . . you just focus on your own tier one suppliers or suppliers of this and you forget about the whole supply chain.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Ready to Start Learning?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">Email us today at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="mailto:info@packagingschool.com">info@packagingschool.com</a> to find out when the next cohort begins. There’s no better time to invest in your future than today. We look forward to talking to you and helping you start a new journey that can have a lasting impact on your life, and maybe, even our world.</p><p style="text-align: start">Learn more about the CMPM at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/certifications/get-to-know-cmpm">https://packagingschool.com/certifications/get-to-know-cmpm</a>.</p>',

      '<p>Have you ever purchased a carton of eggs, only to get home and realize that half are cracked or broken? You were probably less than thrilled upon making this discovery. To prevent this from happening, distribution packaging must be designed with optimum headspace. But, what does all of this jargon mean?</p><p>The term “headspace” describes the clearance between the inside ceiling of a container and the top of the contents or internal structures within the container. There are a wide range of products that can be packaged in corrugated, and the amount of headspace can greatly contribute to—or take away from—the overall compression strength of the corrugated container.</p><p>There are three cases where package-product load sharing affects the amount of headspace needed in a container.<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><em>Fragile contents</em>, like fruit, eggs, and bread, cannot withstand compressive forces without damage.<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><em>Canned products</em><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>have the strength to withstand large amounts of compressive force without sustaining damage. And then there are<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><em>other products</em>, like plastic bottles, that fall somewhere in between. They can support some, but not all of the compressive loads of the distribution environment.</p><p>The most straightforward method for analyzing optimum headspace in a package-product system involves experimental testing using a laboratory compression testing machine. Keep in mind, the values found in the lab experiment will be inflated and not accurately reflect the values which would be observed in the actual distribution environment. In order to compensate and correct for environmental factors, strength reduction factors (SRF) can be applied to the experimental values. The experimental headspace test should test a minimum of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Three samples of the container in question (empty and taped closed)</p></li><li><p>Three sets of samples of the contents (ideally, each set should be composed of the full quantity to be packed in the container if the contents can bear load)</p></li><li><p>Three samples of the internal structures, if applicable (separate from the container)</p></li><li><p>Three samples of the container filled with contents / internal structures in distribution format (taped closed)</p></li></ul><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/1558712235106-OMP0D68AIO7LLP32TRJ7/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kK-cHphgAyjBMwY1DdKl5BBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpz_SyNTfsAaEMV33hXSWIUleRT3M5IdhCIK87kKOIQ2Hup6xDHfon_0FBDxgFOQS-M/Screen+Shot+2019-05-24+at+11.36.55+AM.png?format=750w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-05-24 at 11.36.55 AM.png"><p>Running these tests on a package-product system is critical to the success of the container as it goes through the distribution process.

It appears that Packify.ai allows you to upload in both the .png and .jpeg formats. We decided to use an image we generated from Packify.ai for our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/top-ai-tools-for-packaging-design"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">past blog</span></a> on AI tools for packaging design.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/packify.aiORANGEJUICE.png"><p>Once you choose your image, Packify.ai removes the background and leaves you with something that looks like this:&nbsp;</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 4.13.06 PM.png"><p>As you can see, Packify.ai successfully removes the background, gives an option to reupload, and provides a recommended background on the bottom left. Due to our use of orange juice packaging, the AI recommended a photoshoot involving fresh fruit.</p><p>On the left hand side, you can make a selection from over 40 different background styles—here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 4.15.48 PM.png"><p>During this phase, take time to think about what would work best for your product and the brand message you are trying to convey.&nbsp;</p><p>I chose a background style that includes oranges and a backdrop of plants. Once I select it, my screen appears like this:&nbsp;</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 4.18.14 PM.png"><p>At this phase, all you have to do is click “Start Generating” and let Packify.ai perform its magic.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-07-25 at 4.19.28 PM.png"><p>In about 15 seconds, Packify.ai generated 4 captivating photoshoot images with my chosen packaging design front and center. To download the images, hover your cursor over the image and click the down arrow icon.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\'s explore the results!</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/14jhENKhFuFlpGGIMuPUc_08d037e8437f4f4f8176e57a9b2afe0b.png"><p>The first image placed my orange juice packaging on what seems to be a wooden ledge surrounded by a forest of orange trees. The sliced orange on the left adds a nice touch, and the image looks very authentic. In my opinion, it is not 100% clear that this image is AI-generated (other than the innovative and obscure packaging design I provided).</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/14jhENKhFuFlpGGIMuPUc_07a311e577dd4a7ab72e2fce19efb094.png"><p>The second image is similar to the first, with the bottle sitting on some kind of wooden plank and surrounded by leaves. There are fewer oranges in this image and the ones that do appear are sliced. I enjoy the pop of lighter blue background peeking through the foliage in this image as compared to the first.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/14jhENKhFuFlpGGIMuPUc_d573763711f043ad882f7f8af66fc900.png"><p>The third image is similar to the first, with a lot of oranges and leaves, but it appears our package is on some sort of blue shelf similar in color to the background. The AI also included a lemon in the bottom right corner, adding a further splash of citrus and freshness.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/14jhENKhFuFlpGGIMuPUc_19c9d7a71c4f46e1baa306338f22fd53.png"><p>The fourth and final image is similar to the second as it only includes 2–3 oranges and a lot of leaves. However, for this output, the AI placed our package on some kind of paper-based platform colored kelly green. The paper box is a nice touch and adds some flair to the image. All of the background colors are some shade of blue which nicely complements the vivid hue of the oranges.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><br><strong>More AI Packaging Design Content to Come!&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We have written a handful of packaging-related AI content, including:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/top-ai-tools-for-packaging-design"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Top AI Tools for Packaging Design</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/how-coca-cola-and-mattel-are-using-ai-for-packaging-design"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">How Coca-Cola and Mattel are Using AI for Packaging Design</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/how-to-use-ai-for-packaging-color-inspiration"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">How to Use AI for Packaging Color Inspiration</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/top-free-ai-tools-for-packaging-design"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Top FREE AI Tools for Packaging Design</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more to come!</p><p>To learn more about packaging design principles and best practices, check out our online packaging design courses, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-design-workflow"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Packaging Design Workflow</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/leveraging-human-factors-in-packaging-design"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Leveraging Human Factors in Packaging Design</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/introduction-to-corrugated-design"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Introduction to Corrugated Design</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/package-printing"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Package Printing</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://library.packagingschool.com/packdesign-workshop"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Pack Design Workshop</span></a> (Design Your Own Cereal box!)</p></li></ul>',

      '<p>If you’re anything like me, you feel like a good portion of your life was spent in a classroom, learning from a teacher. From grade school to high school to the final stages of college and graduate school, it felt like the classes, lectures, and seminars were never ending.&nbsp;</p><p>But as I moved into the workforce (thinking that those classroom days were a thing of the past), I realized that learning never truly ends and—wonder of wonders—that’s a good thing. I’ve come to see that the broadening of our minds through knowledge gain is crucial to our existence not only as employees, but as human beings. Just as food nourishes and strengthens our bodies, continued learning nourishes our minds.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Learning Lasts a Lifetime</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start"><span>Of course, I’m not alone in this thinking.

We believe that online learning beyond traditional brick and mortar school walls is an efficient and excellent way to receive continued education in today’s world. In 2017, our organizations recognized the need to adapt our educational methods to the busy, modern professional and this led to the creation of the Beverage Institute by ISBT®. Currently, there are eight </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.isbt.com/isbt-beverage-institute.asp"><span>e-learning courses</span></a><span> available, and we are continuously working with subject matter experts in the beverage industry to build more courses relating to the art and science of beverage technology.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Time on Her Hands</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-bogaczewicz-423b07109/"><span>Natalia Bogaczewicz</span></a><span> (a Beverage Applications Technologist at T. HASEGAWA USA INC.), is a Beverage Institute student. During the pandemic, Natalia found herself with a little extra time on her hands. She decided to put that time toward the development of her career. Her previous job had focused on flavor development, but she wanted an understanding of how the beverage category operates—where it’s going and the proper protocols that are standards throughout the industry. After some online research and the recommendation of a trusted colleague, she enrolled in ISBT’S </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-beverage-technology"><span>Fundamentals of Beverage Technology Course</span></a><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: start"><span>Upon completion of the course, Natalia discovered she had gained a foundational knowledge of beverage production that is consistent throughout the industry, and that she could apply this newfound knowledge in her current role.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Speaking to this point, Natalia said:<br>“<em>What I love about the Fundamentals of Beverage Technology course is that it showed [me] products and development from start to finish</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p><span>Having a better understanding of each process in the creation of a beverage will help her guide customers in the best direction.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: start">Natalia also took the<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/sweetener-course"><span>Sweetener Course</span></a>,<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>which she said really expanded her knowledge and opened her eyes. Her work with flavor development had not offered the opportunity to become familiar with sweeteners, specifically artificial sweeteners. Ultimately, she said it was fascinating to learn about sweetener origins, intensities, and their recommended beverage application.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>What Will YOU Do?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start"><span>The benefits of continued education throughout your career are numerous—an enhanced understanding of the world, open doors to new opportunities, and an improved quality of life. Many people don’t realize the strong link between education and health, but research shows a strong link between reading and overall health. Broadening your knowledge base will keep your brain active and sharp—and also improve your memory (anyone else desperate for help in that area?). And studying to learn more about the field you work in is always a good move!</span></p><p style="text-align: start"><span>Natalia, like me, recognized that learning should be a lifelong pursuit.

      'If you’re anything like me, you feel like a good portion of your life was spent in a classroom, learning from a teacher. From grade school to high school to the final stages of college and graduate school, it felt like the classes, lectures, and seminars were never ending. \n\nBut as I moved into the workforce (thinking that those classroom days were a thing of the past), I realized that learning never truly ends and—wonder of wonders—that’s a good thing. I’ve come to see that the broadening of our minds through knowledge gain is crucial to our existence not only as employees, but as human beings. Just as food nourishes and strengthens our bodies, continued learning nourishes our minds. ',

In the current landscape, companies aim to develop sustainably packaged products they can advertise as “green.”<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.packaginglaw.com/special-focus/global-regulatory-considerations-green-packaging"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>But what has to happen for a company to be able to add labels like this on a product—surely they can’t just slap a carbon neutral certified claim onto any package?<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.carbontrust.com/what-we-do/assurance-and-labelling/carbon-neutral-certification"><sup>4</sup></a> There’s a set of standards one has to meet to make these types of claims, right? Well, that’s what we’re here to find out.</p><p>So, speaking of claims, this is where the FTC comes in. The FTC is an independent agency appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports_annual/one-page-ftc-performance-snapshot/2012snapshotpar.pdf"><sup>5</sup></a> The FTC has been around for a while too—signed into law in 1914 by Woodrow Wilson.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/history"><sup>6</sup></a> </p><p>The mission of this agency is to protect consumers by preventing businesses from becoming unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc"><sup>7</sup></a> The FTC also enhances the public understanding of the competitive process.</p><p>The FTC’s Green Guides are designed to help marketers avoid making misleading environmental claims.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/truth-advertising/green-guides"><sup>8</sup></a> The Green Guides were issued in 1922 and subsequently revised in 1996, 1998, and 2012.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/truth-advertising/green-guides"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp; According to the FTC, the guidance they provide is segmented into three buckets.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/truth-advertising/green-guides"><sup>8</sup></a></p><ol><li><p>General principles that apply to all environmental marketing claims</p></li><li><p>How consumers are likely to interpret particular claims and how marketers can substantiate these claims</p></li><li><p>How marketers can qualify their claims to avoid deceiving consumers</p></li></ol><p>It’s important to note that the Green Guides are not independently enforceable.

To effectively remain current, the Green Guides have to keep up with developments in both science and consumer perception.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/12/federal-trade-commission-votes-to-revamp-green-guides"><sup>10</sup></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this the FTC generally reviews its rules and guidelines at least once every ten years. And the FTC wants you involved. When this review period comes about, they inform the public on their website and ask for input and dialogue. So, you can leave a comment stating your perspective on the use of a certain terminology and advertising, labeling, and packaging. </p><p>For example, claims like “Recyclable,” “Compostable,” and “Degradable” are all included in the current Green Guides. But do these terms need to be amended or made easier for consumers to understand?</p><p>There is also a section on specific claims that have generated a lot of attention over the last few years such as carbon offsets and climate change. You can submit comments here and even browse comments from the general public.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FTC-2022-0077/comments"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>The current version of the Green Guides can be viewed under Title 16 in the electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) as seen here.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-260"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>In light of recurring negotiations to the Green Guides, it is important for companies and marketers alike to stay on top of the changes and consider how they may impact current business strategies.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.steptoe.com/en/news-publications/new-year-new-green-guide-review.html"><sup>9</sup></a> And as a packaging professional, it’s important that when you are making an environmental claim to consult the FTC Green Guides and assess if your claim is appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the FTC Green Guides provide definitions to key terms and examples to ensure fair competition as consumer purchase decisions are influenced by environmental claims.</p>',

The bill,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.packaginglaw.com/news/oregon-bill-banning-pfas-food-containers-becomes-law">SB 543</a>, was signed in May of this year by Governor Kotek. The Oregon law focuses on prohibiting PFAS use in foodware containers. The Oregon state legislature defines “foodware container” as bowls, cups, lids, clamshells, and other takeout packaging for prepared foods. Unlike other bills, Oregon’s does not mention a particular focus on paper- and fiber-based packaging, instead focusing on food containers as a whole.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: left">Maine&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: left">The state of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/32/title32sec1733.html">Maine</a>&nbsp;is set to ban products and packaging sold or distributed in Maine that are created with intentionally added PFAS. The law is to take effect January 1, 2030—a far longer timeline than many other states above. The Maine law also contains an exemption for manufacturers that have less than $1,000,000 USD in total annual sales nationally, meaning the bill will not fully phase out PFAS in food packaging in the state.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-bold">How to Prepare for PFAS Regulations&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: left">As highlighted above, 12 US states have already developed regulations to ban PFAS in food packaging and other industries, with 4 of the 12 states operating under live laws. If you are in the business of paper- and fiber-based food packaging solutions, it is essential to be aware of current and emerging regulations around PFAS and other banned chemicals.</p><p style="text-align: left">With 12 states already acting on research that is not fully developed, it is possible that a nationwide ban could occur as new research regarding PFAS and human health is released.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left">Here at the Packaging School, we have an array of online courses that can help you and your organization prepare for upcoming packaging laws.

Once you have a better understanding of the speedbumps ahead, you can begin to optimize your solution for deployment.&nbsp;</p><p>By leveraging collective expertise, creativity, and insights amongst your stakeholders, solutions can be crafted that are not only environmentally friendly but also commercially viable and technically feasible.&nbsp;</p><h1 class="font-bold"><strong>PROCESSES&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>At a high level, it’s important to think about material usage (think reduce, reuse, recycle), but also energy, and waste, all while aiming to maximize performance, functionality, and appeal to the updated packaged system.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as far as materials are concerned, let’s walk through an example highlighting common material trade-offs.&nbsp;</p><p>So, a multilayer PET flow-wrap like this offers quality such as stiffness, gloss, print protection, and heat resistance for sealing.&nbsp;</p><p>But laminates cannot always be recycled.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/food-technology-magazine/issues/2022/february/columns/packaging-applied-science-commercialization"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are single-layer, mono-material flow-wraps available that can be recycled, even composted—like this.&nbsp;</p><p>So, consider this sustainability example. Here we have a food bar in a PET laminate and over here we have the same bar in an oriented polyethylene—a mono-material.&nbsp;</p><p>While the mono-material is recycle-ready for store drop-off, it can’t achieve the same thermal resistance of PET—which might be important for your product.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/food-technology-magazine/issues/2022/february/columns/packaging-applied-science-commercialization"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>This is one of many possible trade-offs to be uncovered.&nbsp;</p><p>You may find that while the more sustainable material theoretically works for your product, it may require upgrading your sealing equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example may be that a newer material is more brittle, requiring that you reduce your production line speeds.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/food-technology-magazine/issues/2022/february/columns/packaging-applied-science-commercialization"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>There is also a consumer perception trade-off that is worth investigating.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though sustainable packaging is often perceived as higher product quality due to its “naturalness,” it can also have an impact on the perceived aesthetic quality as well—biodegradable and compostable materials tend to be cloudier and more opaque than conventional plastics, whose transparency is associated with an attractive, fresh, and reliable product.<sup>7,8</sup></p><p>Let’s also look at PET—you know that number one plastic—versus PLA.&nbsp;</p><p>So, PET has strong chemical properties that prevent microorganisms and chemicals from leaching through, while PLA’s barrier is not as resistant to microorganisms and chemicals.&nbsp;</p><p>So, based on this, PET can therefore be used for long shelf life products, whereas PLA is typically used only for short shelf life products.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rplanetearth.com/why-choose-rpet-recycled-pet-plastic-cups-over-pla-plant-based-cups/"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>PLA melts at a lower heat capacity and its structure will deform more easily.

      '<p>Transportation by air, sea, truck and train all serve the same purpose—to get the product to the customer. Each carrier mode, however, has its own unique characteristics, and each package must be designed with the carrier mode in mind. A high protective barrier is sometimes necessary for shipping by sea, as the long journey can present corrosion and condensation issues. Traveling by truck comes with its own issues where vibration can damage products. Let’s look further at truck distribution.</p><p>Truck shipments are divided into two broad categories: less than truckload (LTL) and full truck load (FTL). For LTL, shipments do not require the space of an entire truck, so an LTL carrier only requires a company to pay for the space needed. For example, if a shipment takes one third of a truck, an LTL provider charges you for the space of one third of a truck. The remainder of the truck will be filled with other customer products. LTL is ideal for small companies, but more packaging can be required to keep the multiple size packages and products safe. Consolidating items into a large palletized shipment can also help avoid damage and reduce handling time.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5d07d48d481e4f0001c2f8d3/1560794266429/Screen+Shot+2019-06-17+at+1.57.04+PM.png?format=1500w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-17 at 1.57.04 PM.png"><p><strong>LTL</strong> and parcel have higher potential for product damage from overpackaging. Since LTL shipments are comprised of small shipments from several companies, the carrier is not organized as efficiently which creates void spaces. To compensate for the void spaces, trucks are often overpacked. LTL companies may not be as careful with handling since they have less invested in the safety of the products.</p><p>The delivery of LTL shipments is a process that involves consolidation with shipments from other companies with destinations in the same direction. If the shipment is small, sturdy, and not on a strict time schedule, then LTL is the best option.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5d07d4b607db5c0001e8884c/1560794298393/Screen+Shot+2019-06-17+at+1.56.28+PM.png?format=1000w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-17 at 1.56.28 PM.png"><p><strong>FTL shipments</strong>, on the other hand, consist exclusively of products from the same company. That company makes sure to load the carrier by nesting the pallets in a way that reduces void spaces. This eliminates the need for overpackaging and also lessens the amount of dunnage needed between pallets. If a shipment is large and delicate, FTL is the best option. FTL shipments are delivered by a much simpler process than LTL since everything is done through one company and the carrier is filled with only one full shipment headed to the same destination. Dunnage bags are also used in FTL carriers for the same reason, but since FTL shipments typically fit together well, void spaces are less of a problem.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5d07d4fb8c10ca0001e54d43/1560794364790/Screen+Shot+2019-06-17+at+1.56.47+PM.png?format=750w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-17 at 1.56.47 PM.png"><p>Knowledge of the distribution chain is crucial to developing proper transport packaging. For instance, if you have your own fleet or tight control over your 3PL, an FTL design can use significantly less protective packaging than something going LTL or parcel. When you have control over the full unitized load, the packaging system is much different than a box for eCommerce parcel delivery. Determining the best type of shipment for your products is based on shipment size, budget, freight fragility, and time constraints.</p><p>LTL packages also travel in a hub-like system and can be transferred multiple times before finally reaching their destination. Therefore, FTL freight arrives at its destination faster than LTL. A timetable, however, can be provided by LTL carriers to estimate delivery times. As seen in this graphic, FTL shipments are simply taken from point A to point B, while LTL makes several stops and pickups along the way.</p><p>When properly designed, transport packaging safely gets a product from the manufacturer to the customer. There are many functions and goals of transport packaging, but they all exist to ensure safe travels for a product to meet the customer’s needs.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-distribution">Learn more about this in our Packaging Distribution course</a>, or check out our other programs in the<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/all_courses/">course library</a>!</p>',

      "<p>So, the other day I needed some shoes. I went online to check them out, and I was given the option of selecting up to three shoes that I might want, and, without paying for them, I ordered them and they arrived in this box.</p><p>And now I have the opportunity to check them out, try them on, and I have seven days to make a decision.</p><p>So, let's see how packaging can influence your decision, pre-purchase, in your own home.</p><p>By the end of this short lesson, you will be able to:</p><ul><li style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\"><p>Analyze how e-commerce packaging can influence your buying decisions&nbsp;</p></li><li style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\"><p>Investigate material and design elements when unboxing your (shoe) packaging&nbsp;</p></li><li style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\"><p>Examine the correlation of quality between the packaging and the products within</p></li></ul><p>Alright, so look how they came. These look like ordinary shoe boxes, which they are. They got some dunnage off to the side.</p><p>Let's take them out. This one looks nice. Now they all cost different, but the price tag is not here, so that becomes a little interesting to really know which one is greater value.</p><p>This one's nice. Got some gold foil on it. And here's another one, and here's another one. This one seems pretty bare bones. I've got the product size, product details here, but this one over here just is a little level up. There's a little claim and it really does stand out. It is high contrast. And this one, this one looks totally different. I've got, instead of, you know, one piece design here, I have a two piece design. I've got foil, I've got a different color, I've got foil out here. I've got a nice, something that's standing out and, you know, some icon, nice claim, still have the product information on the outside.</p><p>So, clearly one of these looks different than the rest. And this one over here seems to be, there's something a little bit more special, and over here it kind of feels, you know, as I would've expected. Maybe it's a good, better, best.</p><p>So, this is what we have. And when we're looking straight down on this, there are some differences. These corrugated containers themselves are of the same material, but this one has a rollover. There's just a nicer finish. Look at this. You see this really nice rollover finish compared to the exposed corrugations and different materials. It just comes across a little bit different, and it does make a difference.</p><p>The shoes themselves are wrapped in paper. So we've got paper here, another full wrap of paper here, but there's something just a little bit different here. Look at this. It's branded—got a branded paper. And you know, my first instinct is like—I wonder if it's a higher quality shoe, right? It's just different in this stack.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a divider from each. So, we're going here for the . . . for what appears to be less premium. It's just a piece of one, one sided board, kind of just kinda just folded, stuck in there. Over here, instead of being folded, it's just a single sheet. So, there's a little bit of difference here, but same brand. When looking here, I have double white, so it's just a little bit of an upgrade here.</p><p>Let's look at the products themselves and see if there's any major differences. So, let’s go ahead and unbox these guys.</p><p>In terms of the product, it's the same style of shoe. We're just going, what appears to be, from good, better, best. And let's see that.</p><p>We've already seen that in the primary packaging, but what about just in the packing of the product? I'm gonna go for these bare ones. They have, like a paper straw, really. It's just a paper tube that's going in and it's holding the shoes up with wadded up paper. So we've got this here. And what I like about this is that it's a hundred percent recyclable. I could toss all of this in the recycling center. Next up is, it looks very similar. I still have these paper tubes, but they're much more stout. If you can see here, it’s much thicker and it still bends, but this one definitely came deformed. These ones look really good, really straight, but definitely more sturdy and stout. Let's pull out and see what they have protecting these shoes. It's different. I have a wadded piece of paper, but on top of it I've got a formed piece of paper and there's no coating on it. It's just, it looks like it's just been pressed and formed, definitely different—maybe it holds up the shoe a little bit better. But definitely when comparing, there certainly is a difference. We'll see these premium shoes here. Now the premium shoes don't have anything pushing onto the back, but they certainly have a different way of holding up these shoes. Kind of snug in there. Well, look at that. This is significantly different. We've got a fully molded pulp which is recyclable in the paper waste stream. So, this actually had a tool around it and this is a pulp option, you know, a really nice one-piece. There's a big difference here.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in the future context of making a decision, when the marketplace comes to you, we're gonna see a lot more of that in the future of the products coming into a home and then you're trying them on and looking at them, and you'll be making these types of decisions. Little tiny things can make or break a decision because I haven't paid for these now, and now I still have seven days to try them all out to see which one I want. But the packaging certainly had an impression. They were very different. There were much more premium materials used throughout that entire unboxing process, including as it went directly on into the product protection.</p><p>So, as you're thinking about your products and thinking about the future of the marketplace where you and your competition, or maybe even within your own product portfolio, are here side-by-side, how are you using packaging to communicate the quality of the product as we go from good, better, to best.</p>",

A modern dieline will commonly contain different layers such as structural and graphic layers, and CAD software can easily align these layers to allow for much faster design times than drafting by hand. To ensure functionality, these completed dielines are uploaded to drafting tables where the prototypes are made.</p><p>Die manufacturers use dielines to program the laser engravers which draw the die layout on the die board. Graphical dieline layers are denoted by ink color, and can then be used to produce the necessary printing plates for the printing process. Structural layers will include all details related to the structure itself, such as dimensions and locations of cut/crease/fold lines, and the gluing areas when applicable.</p><p>Cutting and creasing are the two main processes used to form corrugated containers, making it critical for them to be represented on the dieline. The flaps on a box must fold along a predetermined area, so they are scored to aid in folding. Other parts of a box or carton, such as the main profile or outline of the structure, may require full separation from the rest of the board. And still other areas may require perforations for tear tabs or for easy separation of components later in the process.</p><p>Another consideration when designing a dieline involves folding. When paper is folded, it loses some space on the inside of the fold while gaining space on the outside of the fold. With a regular sheet of paper, this change is so minimal it does not have much of an impact until it is folded several times. Because corrugated is much thicker, the outside gains and inside losses are much more apparent and need to be accounted for with what is called the “scoring allowance.” Corrugated will fold at its midpoint (except for certain double wall scenarios) so the scoring allowance is directly related to the caliper of the board.</p><p>Creating a dieline is necessary to the box making process—it’s the blueprint those on the manufacturing and production side of things use to build your package.

A modern dieline will commonly contain different layers such as structural and graphic layers, and CAD software can easily align these layers to allow for much faster design times than drafting by hand. To ensure functionality, these completed dielines are uploaded to drafting tables where the prototypes are made.',

      '<p>Glass is a beautiful substrate that serves its purpose as a primary package with an elegant look of sophistication and quality. In this blogpost, we’ll share insight on how this material is viewed by consumers, the advantages and disadvantages of using it, as well as its applications in packaging for industries such as food, beverage cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals . . . all very important things!</p><p>Most consumers equate glass with high quality, so most will assume that the product within is also of high quality. Brands wanting to give their product a vintage or “old-fashioned” feel may choose this packaging substrate. Products like jams and preserves are ideal for this. Many consumers don’t consider environmentally friendly packaging an option anymore—it’s now an expectation. Luckily, glass is perceived to be a highly recyclable package. It offers product transparency, which is an important factor for purchase intent in the retail setting. As a rigid structure, it is also sturdy enough to withstand a high amount of force and protect the product.</p><p>There are plenty of advantages to using glass as a packaging material. It can be recycled infinitely without a reduction in quality. It is chemically inert—both nonporous and impermeable, which means it is resistant to the transmission of gases and particles. There are no interactions between glass packaging and products to affect the flavor of food and beverages, even when microwaved. Glass is used extensively to contain delicate flavor and perfume essences. Although certain acids will affect this material, they are primarily used for etching designs. Generally, the substrate provides a strong barrier against a wide variety of acids and bases used in chemistry. The main components of glass are sand, soda ash, and limestone which are relatively inexpensive, plentiful, domestic, raw materials. Since it is included on the FDA’s “GRAS” (or generally recognized as safe) list, glass doesn’t require any product compatibility testing, such as those for leaching and extraction. Other packaging materials must be tested for migrating substances between the product and the package.</p><p>Despite all of these positive attributes, there are several downsides. Due to the high heat needed to melt the raw materials, glass has a rather energy-intensive manufacturing process. Despite lightweighting efforts, it is heavier than a comparably-sized plastic or aluminum container, making it more costly to transport the same number of containers. The high cost of transportation coupled with the low number of recycling plants has led to a reduced municipal recycling rate—in the US that is. Other areas of the world, such as Europe, provide government incentives. And as we all know, glass can be easily breakable, though breakability is being improved with the new coatings that reduce abrasion.</p><p>Glass is primarily used as a container for food items like beverages, sauces, condiments, oils, jellies, and dessert toppings. The usage of this material in food and consumer packaging has decreased by a significant margin compared to previous years. There has been a steady increase in the use of plastics in place of glass since those packages are lighter, more resilient, and more cost-efficient.</p><p>Glass, however, is still pertinent today because it provides a unique and premium experience that plastics just cannot match. Unlike other packaging materials that rely on stacking layers together to achieve specific properties, glass is an all-in-one solution. For instance, amber glass keeps UV light from penetrating the packaging and breaking down a beverage like beer, whereas a plastic application may have to use more than 5 layers of various polymers to achieve similar barrier properties. It is greatly sought out as packaging for beer, wine, and fine liquors.</p><p>In general, the cosmetics industry is focused on image and presentation, whether it is for advertisement, product, or the end-use buyer. To satisfy the need for refined appearance, cosmetic companies still choose to put their products in glass packaging. Though the inherent properties fulfill the typical cosmetic product’s marketing design approach, the primary reason for the use is tradition and standardization across the supply chain and category. Suppliers and co-packers of cosmetic products are used to handling glass. Historically, it has been used for cosmetic and perfume packaging for its inertness and purity (although, that is achievable with other substrates in today’s market). Customized glass packaging is more expensive to replicate and is an advantageous anti-counterfeiting choice for this sector, which already has a high percentage of counterfeiting compared to other retail products. But the primary reason it is used in this category is competitiveness—products need to have a high-end appearance in this crowded market if they want to sell. Glass has a shelf impact unlike any other packaging material, with clarity, shape, and texture that cannot be matched by other materials. The transparency of glass allows for a clear showcase of the product, while the material’s strength contributes to its premium appearance and feel.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry produces very sensitive products that ensure human health and wellbeing, and primary containers come in direct contact with pharmaceutical chemicals and compounds. Again, glass’ inertness and purity make it a perfect choice in this sector. Pharmacological packaging is subject to special ethical standards and regulations, and Type I glass (or borosilicate) meets the most stringent requirements needed for medications. Pharmaceutical packaging most often made from glass are jars, ampoules, vials, and cartridges.</p><p>In the food packaging realm, there has been an undeniable shift to the use of plastic over glass, but as we have seen, it is still relied upon to give an air of refinement, nostalgia, or safety to the product within.</p><p>If you liked this blog post and want to learn more about Glass Packaging, sign up for our online <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/glass-metal-packaging">Glass &amp; Metal Packaging Course</a>!</p>',

      '<p>For our readers in the United States (and all who celebrate), Happy Fourth of July!&nbsp;</p><p>In honor of the holiday, we decided to explore the use of packaging in colonial America, a period that <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.gsa.gov/real-estate/historic-preservation/explore-historic-buildings/explore-by-timeline/colonial-america-revolution-15651783"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">ranges from 1565 to 1783</span></u></a>. While many could conjure up images of petticoats, taverns, or farmsteads when envisioning colonial America, the packaging nerds here at The Packaging School go down a whole different track and wonder instead how precious goods were packaged, stored, and transported.&nbsp;</p><p>Colonial Americans used an array of materials and packaging systems to store goods from dry grains and flours to alcoholic beverages, oils, and medicines—for the sake of this blog, we will focus on the use of barrels and glass bottles, planning to explore other packaging systems in later blogs. Join us as we explore how packaging enabled colonists to trade and store the goods and foods that helped society run efficiently.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Barrels</strong></h3><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/barrelv1 (1).png"><p>One of the first packaging systems in Colonial America that comes to mind is the barrel—a container vital for shipping and storing both dry and liquid products.

But despite differences in applications, the core use involved long-term storage of dry and wet materials—enabling the colonists to ensure food security, store vital tools and materials, and trade effectively without damaging or spoiling the goods contained within.&nbsp;</p><p>When you stop and think about it, barrels were a rather sustainable and circular packaging system, as the raw materials were sourced locally, the manufacturing process was not very energy intensive, and barrels could be cleaned and reused as long as they were needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at the types and use of glass bottles in the colonial era . . .</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Glass Bottles</strong></h3><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/glassv2 (1).png"><p>Glass was not the most widely used material in colonial times, due to its fragility and technical nature of manufacturing, but it did serve a purpose in select applications. The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://whatson.cmog.org/exhibitions-galleries/glass-america"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Corning Museum of Glass</span></u></a> highlights that glassmaking is one of America’s first industries, with evidence of a glass workshop being present in Jamestown, VA in the year 1608. The shop failed due to natural disasters and economic circumstances, therefore, the colonists\' main source of glass was imported from England during much of the 1600s. Due to this, glass was often seen as a marker of status in colonial America, with mirrors and glass windows serving as indicators of wealth.&nbsp;</p><p>The first successful glass company in the 13 colonies, Wistarburgh Glassworks, was founded in New Jersey in 1739 by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entries/caspar-wistar/"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Caspar Wistar</span></u></a>, a German immigrant. The factory primarily produced glass windows and bottles, producing an excess of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cmog.org/audio/richard-wistar-bottle-311"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">15,000 bottles a year</span></u></a>—a big feat for its day. The bottle pictured below, on display at the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cmog.org/audio/richard-wistar-bottle-311"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Corning Museum of Glass</span></u></a>, was created by Wistarburgh Glassworks between 1745 and 1755.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CMGWGW.jpg"><p>Most glass bottles produced in the American colonies were green, as the colonists did not have access to pure silica sand, meaning they had to use sand with impurities (high iron content). The bottle above was said to be manufactured using a technique from the Middle Ages in Europe. The stamp contains the initials of Richard Wistar, son of Caspar Wistar and likely the head of Wistarburgh Glassworks at the time of production. Labels like these are early examples of packaging serving as a vessel for branding and brand identity.</p><p>Glass bottles were used for storing alcoholic beverages, medicine, and many types of oil. Bottles also housed sauces, inks for writing, perfumes, pickling food, and much more. As glass became more prevalent in the colonies, the glass bottle was more accessible and, therefore, utilized in many households for consuming liquids, storage, and other applications.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Want to Learn More About Packaging?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Studying these two packaging systems in colonial America—barrels and glass bottles—makes us realize how far the packaging industry has come. From barrels and glass bottles to today’s innovative materials and technologies, the evolution of the packaging industry continues to catalyze the storage and transportation of the goods we rely on most.&nbsp;</p><p>Since <u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">t</span></u><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">he Packaging School</span></u></a><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">’s</span></u> founding in 2015, we have been dedicated to exploring and educating the industry on the advancements in packaging that have shaped and will continue to shape our world.

      "<p>Glass is one of the most recyclable materials used in packaging. In fact, the material itself is 100% recyclable, and can be recycled endlessly without a loss of quality. So, if that’s the case, then why is only one third of the glass in the US being recycled? Many recycling centers in the country don’t even accept glass, making it difficult for those who would like to recycle it. However, Zeb Parsons and the team at Bricolage Dynamics are working to change that. We got to sit down with Zeb to learn about the problems he sees with glass recycling today, and how Bricolage Dynamics is looking to take your old glass and turn it into sand.</p><p><strong>Andrew Hurley</strong>: So, if you were to summarize the problem for people that don’t know, why is glass a problem?</p><p><strong>Zeb Parsons</strong>: I would say one of the biggest problems is single-stream recycling, so collecting everything into one bin. You'll typically see glass being the first recyclable cut, because it breaks and it contaminates, well, it contaminates the big money makers like the metal and the cardboard. And so, it's hard to then sort out. It's rough on the sorting equipment too. You know, these recovery facilities, you know, they're not in the business of—a lot of them are private—and they're not in the business of losing money. For that, and because there is no strong, there's not been a very robust end market in a lot of locations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew Hurley</strong>: So what makes you different from your typical, you know, material recovery facility?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zeb</strong>: Well, I'm hedging my bets on the United States is gonna switch. We switched to single-stream recycling back in, I wanna say, the eighties, nineties. And, I am hedging my bets that we're gonna go the way of Europe and switch to multi-stream and have everything separated. So, the reason this works for us is because, I guess, we're already doing that. You know, I think our households probably aren't consciously thinking about the fact that they're participating in multi-stream recycling, but by keeping glass separate from the household, to us being the processor, it allows us to, we don't care if the glass breaks. Our contamination rates are next to nothing. We don't have to worry about the plastic or the cardboard or the metal. So, it really kind of simplifies the supply chain.&nbsp;</p><p>And it also works for us because we're vertically integrated. So, usually, in recycling, you'll have one entity that just collects and transports and then one entity that processes. And so, we do both, which, I think, kind of allows us to pivot a little faster and keep up with, kind of, the changing market conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew</strong>: So you collect and you process. Can you tell us a little bit about how you collect and the different types of sources that you collect from?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zeb:</strong> Yeah, so, we collect from commercial customers and residential customers. You know, residential is straightforward—that's just probably mostly single family households. We do a few apartments. And then commercial could be anything from bars and restaurants to, we do recycling for—today, actually, we're picking up for the BMW Charity Pro-Am.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew</strong>: When you think about these collection points, you've got commercial and you have residential. What are the challenges for those?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zeb</strong>: We don't really have any challenges on that end. I think our biggest problem, like any startup, is just, kind of, a capital issue. We've never not had more demand than we can keep up with, and so it's always just a matter of getting there. And getting into manufacturing is an expensive endeavor. And so, it's always interesting. The first time we raised money, even the people we raised it through, they're like, yeah, it's kind of, you have a reverse issue. Because most people try to raise money to then find the business, go into sales, and drum it up, and then, you know, bring it all in. And for us, it's just always just trying to raise some capital to get there. So, as far as our customers go, it's just a matter of having the processing equipment and the trucks and things to be able to facilitate their recycling efforts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, so, the demand is there. You have more interest than you can even accommodate for. So, that's on the collection end. So, on the processing end, can you tell us about the different types of products that you make?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zeb</strong>: Yeah, so initially, everything comes in, I mean, bottles, broken bottles. We have our main pulverizer, which you guys will see, and it produces a 3/8 minus glass rock. And a 1, what is it, 1/8 minus sand aggregate, which is kind of a, like, a river sand equivalent. So it's kind of, river sand, you'd have, like, small little, kind of, stones and things like that in there. So, those are our main products.&nbsp;</p><p>And then we have a secondary sifter where we're doing samples at the moment to, kind of, drum up demand for more specialty sand. So, that goes all the way down to, like, a 100 micron, like, fine, white powder. And there's all sorts of stuff in between. I mean, we do, like, a small glass cullet that can be used for sandblasting, and then, we do water filtration sand. So, there's a lot of options.&nbsp;</p><p>Sand is one of the world's most in-demand raw materials, and so, there's all sorts of uses people don't think sand can be utilized in that just, even in any real town or city in the United States, will have, kind of, a diverse demand for.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew</strong>: So, you're able to take glass bottles from residences and companies, pulverize it, and you're turning it into sand. Tell us about sand. Like, why is sand important? Why can't we just go to the beach and harvest our sand there?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Zeb</strong>: Sand is, I think they say it's, it's the number 2 world's most exploited natural resource. So, people don't think about the world having a sand shortage, but the UN just published, I wanna say, toward the end of last year, that the world was about to surpass the natural replenishment rate of sand. And so, it's actually led to a black market in Asia. And it's leading to ocean sterilization, the dredging of sand—they have these huge barges that are pulling out enormous quantities of sand out of river beds that cause the banks to collapse, and then it ruins the fishing in the area. And, well, I'd say one of the biggest benefits of us—and people don't really think about it because they like to recycle, and they're just like, okay, well, my glass is out the ground, it's being reused, but one of the biggest benefits, I would say—is the fact that we are, kind of, cutting that negative part of the supply chain out. Even if just to a small degree, at the moment, and creating something that is actually doing quite a bit of environmental harm and being able to produce that locally and help subsidize that market with, with material that's, you know, got a great, you know, second life, second life to it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah. I'm just kind of curious—are there, out of other folks that are, you know, collecting glass, repurposing it, what makes Bricolage different?</p><p><strong>Zeb</strong>: Well, I think one of the big things is that we're vertically integrated, like I said, so we do our own pickup and processing. Our model, kind of, our approach to the market is more 2 and a half hour radius supply chains, and instead of one big organization in the southeast, I'd like to see smaller but more prevalent supply chains. Again, just to, kind of, what is called cutting CO2 emissions. But, I mean, just to, kind of, optimize the logistics, that's something that's kind of unique about our approach. And, we're for-profit as well. So, you do have other organizations that are doing similar things, that are popping up other places, but a lot of people go into it as a nonprofit. And so, for us, you know, a scalable problem needs a scalable solution, and I personally feel the best way to tackle it is through profitability and bringing on the right partners and things like that. In my opinion, it's very hard to count on a large workforce of volunteers and grant funding and having to write constantly to try and find money out of these grant pools. I didn't really wanna live that way, and so, I decided that we were gonna go and make it work and make some money at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Another question is on the collection side. . . I mean, you're collecting all types of glass and all types of interesting things, working, you know, for all different types of companies as well. Do you ever find anything interesting in the things that you collect?</p><p><strong>Zeb</strong>: Yeah. We do find, we do find interesting things. We find old glass from time to time, usually from just random households; it's never like somebody calls. I don't understand why people get rid of it because it's just, I don't know, some really interesting old medicine bottles and Pepsi bottles, Coke bottles, things like that. And then we get quite a bit of crystal as well, Pyrex, some really beautiful Waterford pieces, Polish crystal. And so, that kind of stuff, we try to separate out and make sure that—you know, eventually, I think we're gonna start selling that separately down the road—but, give that a separate life because I don't really have the heart to break it.&nbsp;</p><p>I never thought I would end up in glass recycling personally. It's interesting, kind of, the way the world, the world takes you sometimes—you know, best made plans. So, yeah, it's interesting. You know, I, at one point thought I was going to be in the corporate world forever and ever, and, you know, not working out of my basement for a number of years. But it's interesting what you kinda, you know, find along the way and say yes to different opportunities, what can kinda happen down the road.</p><p>We’d like to thank Zeb and the team at Bricolage Dynamics for taking the time to speak with us!

      '<p>What would a circular economy look like? Have we already embraced a circular economy or is it a theoretical pie-in-the-sky approach that is unattainable? Think beyond the “take, make and dispose” industrial model and imagine an economy that promotes greater resource productivity—one that reduces waste and avoids pollution by expanding on the cradle to cradle approach. This is termed the circular economy system, which sets an outline of how to create a circular flow of materials and energy.</p><p>The circular economy is restorative and regenerative in its design. This model aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value. With a circular economy, products no longer have a life cycle with a beginning, middle, and end. To predict sustainable management, the positive and negative impacts of a material’s life cycle is analyzed as they are produced and consumed. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://greenblue.org/">GreenBlue</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://sustainablepackaging.org/">SPC</a> use this circular design tool to evaluate how materials move within a system and how they can impact the environment. To use materials wisely, it is key to recover value from the material because the outputs, which may not be useful in one specific industrial system are in another.</p><p>The Circular Economy operates on three principles. <strong>Principle 1</strong> is to preserve and enhance natural capital. This is done by controlling finite resources and stabilizing the flow of renewable resources. When resources are needed, the circular system chooses wisely and only utilizes technologies with renewable or optimized resources. Natural capital is enhanced by encouraging nutrient flow within the system and creating conditions for regeneration such as soil for renewable resources.</p><p><strong>Principle 2</strong> is to optimize resource yields. In order to keep a circular economy afloat, products, components, and materials need to be circulated at the highest utility. This means that the system is looked at as a whole and designed to be created as a circular system, rather than each individual component being separate from the next. This circulation applies to both the technical and biological cycles.</p><p><strong>Principle 3</strong> is to foster system effectiveness. This is done by revealing and getting rid of negative side effects from designs and productions. Reduce damage to human utility such as food, shelter, and health. This also includes managing side effects such as land use, air and water pollution, and the release of toxic substances. A company that works to eliminate negative side effects is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.jnj.com/">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>—they implemented the GAIA (Global Aquatic Ingredient Assessment) tool that creates environmental “scores” on the commonly used ingredients within their materials.</p><p>As a result, the circular economy is gaining interest with a steady momentum as companies realize the need to manage materials and resources. It is being embraced by some companies, but more companies need to rethink their current processes and adapt to this way of sustainable thinking.</p><p>Learn more about this topic in our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/sustainable-packaging">Sustainable Packaging</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>course!</p>',

Although the package looks clean and premium, it turns a traditional mono-material cereal box into a packaging system that is much harder to separate, sort, and recycle at many MRFs (materials recovery facilities) across the nation.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe8M5YU4A7jVHP4gmlgvxS3rDZZf2qbVOkxjnZgZMMU8MSIbLm7UvmDCK8XX8vZ8921_Ntqx_mYzXgsUZfMRypg9wCVgmwpGjZCFnGcB4Rl9ZAJOG5uym5Pudvd0pL0twyBI9oOIMkFijsftYvn5vEhs4iu?key=TbUs2X9uADGVPHBok-pyeg"><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">Similar to the first image, Canva once again placed cereal in a paper-based package that contains a plastic window to view the product—yet again turning a traditional mono-material cereal box into an MRF\'s nightmare.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">You might notice that none of the design mockups so far, from either Fotor or Canva, include pictures of the product on the outside of the package. They instead use a plastic window to view the product or no view at all.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">You can access Canva’s Magic Studio tools with the free version, making it a convenient choice if your team already uses Canva for daily marketing and content creation.

Many of the outputs generated cereal that seems to be packaged at home or in an extremely fancy market. As you can see, Adobe’s AI packaged the cereal in a large glass jar and used kraft paper to add a decorative component, similar to if the cereal was a gift. There is no denying that </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/glass-metal-packaging"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">glass packaging</span></u></a><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"> is a sustainable option with its high recycling rate, but when was the last time you saw cereal packaged in glass on store shelves?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">It is fascinating that many of the softwares seem to overthink “sustainability” for cereal boxes—so much so that they overcomplicate the designs with unnecessary, in my opinion, translucent windows that add materials and make recycling difficult, if possible at all. It seems that generative AI tools are still lacking when it comes to understanding prompts related to sustainable packaging, as they can turn ready-to-recycle mono-material solutions into multi-material packages that look appealing but miss the mark on overall environmental impact.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">Users with the free version of Adobe Express have access to generative AI tools like the Text to Image generator, but through the use of credits. Free users receive 25 credits a month, where each prompt entered counts as one credit. So in keeping with the process for using Canva or Fotor, approach the software with a strategy and list of prompts from your design team to get the most out of the credits available.&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="font-bold"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pixlr.com/image-generator/">PIXLR – AI Image Generator</a>&nbsp;</h3><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcpo6I-u6BvfuYn-KsaKLbEOkKyATslw7zFqMLdhnQyX3kZbk2lkq3mKToE0LRurBFtBx9eqrqicrb7OY-gi1DG0Tgy1eb7IG_ccmV-kbVMSehEjf2U9bt3Ea2oLXK2C5j1GNDXx00YvRShiPGlNSv-fsgN?key=TbUs2X9uADGVPHBok-pyeg"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pixlr.com/image-generator/"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">PIXLR</span></u></a><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"> is a free photo editing and generative AI platform with an array of tools including advanced and AI photo editing, AI background erasing, bulk photo editing, and more.

The designs display grains, cereals, and, in some cases, images of the product contained within—no cartoon characters here! The material seems to be paperboard or some type of </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/polymers-in-packaging"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">polymer</span></u></a><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">.

Some of the packages are not even complete packages, like the one seen bottom center (slightly left) in the image above. It’s more like three packages morphed into one—sometimes you get funny results with generative AI.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">Pixlr gives all users access to the AI Image Generator, with the ability to input three prompts (twelve images) for free before being asked to upgrade to one of the paid plans. The entry level plan, Pixlr+, is ad-free and grants 80 monthly credits for AI tools like the AI Image Generator. Similar to other tools, we recommend coming up with well thought-out prompts prior to experimentation.</span></p><h1 class="font-bold"><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>Common Themes Across Tools&nbsp;</strong></span></h1><h3 class="font-bold"><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>The Prominence of Paper</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">An overwhelming majority of the outputs generated from the uniform prompt “sustainable cereal packaging” were packages primarily made from a type of paper.

The softwares seemed to notice that a number of consumers prefer translucent plastic film windows to view products before purchase, but that is rarely (if ever) used in the application of cereal packaging.</span></p><h3 class="font-bold"><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>Ease of Use&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">If you are an AI newcomer or a seasoned prompter, you will find these tools easy to access and use. Tools like Canva and Adobe Express may already exist in many organizations\' suite of creative tools, allowing team members and packaging designers to explore AI and text to image features without subscribing to a new platform.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">We demonstrated a simple prompt today for ease of comparison, but you can go in depth with prompts to fit your specific brainstorming and ideation needs.

Here are three tips he offers for getting started with text to image tools:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>1. PROVIDE RELEVANT CONTEXT: </strong>Offer enough background information for the AI to&nbsp; grasp the scenario, but keep it focused and relevant to packaging design. I often provide source images with explicit instructions to match or ignore certain aspects of style or color.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>2. DEFINE YOUR GOAL</strong>: Clearly outline what you aim to achieve with your prompt. Are you looking for design inspiration, packaging solutions, or material suggestions? I tend to overlook this part and want to dive right in. If you aren’t getting the results you are looking for, the error is in the prompt (assuming the model you are using is built to provide your desired results).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>3. EXPERIMENT AND ITERATE:</strong> Test different prompts and refine based on the AI’s responses. Iteration helps in finding the most effective way to communicate your needs. This has been the most effective method for evolving how I shape prompts. A little experimentation today can save a lot of time down the road.</span></p><h3 class="font-bold"><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><strong>More AI for Packaging Design Content to Come!&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">This is our fourth content piece related to using </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/top-ai-tools-for-packaging-design"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">AI tools</span></u></a><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"> to aid in the </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-design-workflow"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">packaging design process</span></u></a><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">; we plan to continue to dive into different AI platforms in the following months in order to help our community of packaging professionals uncover the best tools for brainstorming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">To learn more about the world of packaging design, check out our online courses including:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/leveraging-human-factors-in-packaging-design"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Leveraging Human Factors in Packaging Design&nbsp;</span></u></a></p></li><li style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-design-workflow"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Packaging Design Workflow</span></u></a></p></li><li style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://library.packagingschool.com/packdesign-workshop"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Pack Design Workshop (Design Your Own Cereal Box!)</span></u></a></p></li><li style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/augmented-reality-for-packaging"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Augmented Reality for Packaging (Free!)</span></u></a><span style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23)">&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul>',

      '<p>In today’s blog, we’re talking about palletization, but before you start picturing the latest eyeshadow palette in the beauty industry, here’s a quick rundown to point you in the right direction.</p><p style="text-align: start">Palletization, at the most basic level, is a process used in the industry to help ship products in a safe and efficient manner. Pallets are used to bundle groups of primary or secondary packages together for easier shipping and handling. The different tiers of packaging are based on the headspace of the product. Companies often have a stock pallet type used for everything to help keep the packaging, shipping, and storing processes as simple as possible. If a company is making custom order products of all different sizes, however, there would be many different types of pallets.</p><p style="text-align: start">Let’s look at a few pallet types.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5cf8125a7c62a10001a908c6/1559761500005/Screen+Shot+2019-06-05+at+3.04.17+PM.png?format=500w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-05 at 3.04.17 PM.png"><p><strong>Compressed Wood Pallets</strong>:</p><p>Compressed wood pallets are cheap, moderately strong, and unique in that they nest inside each other for space saving when not in use. The downside is their parts cannot be replaced, so they are not repairable like standard wooden pallets. The upside is they are recyclable after use.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5cf812c34354140001d7eda5/1559761606125/Screen+Shot+2019-06-05+at+3.06.14+PM.png?format=750w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-05 at 3.06.14 PM.png"><p><strong>Corrugated Paperboard Pallets</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Corrugated can be used to make pallets. Multiple layers of corrugated substrate are glued together to produce strong pallets which can be recycled just as easily as corrugated boxes. These pallets have a much shorter lifespan than that of their wooden counterparts, but work in pinch situations where they are only needed as a short term solution. Corrugated pallets can be quickly designed in a number of different styles and sizes.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5cf8132ae66f8b000181895d/1559761707743/Screen+Shot+2019-06-05+at+3.01.31+PM.png?format=750w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-05 at 3.01.31 PM.png"><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Plastic Pallets</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">High density plastics can be molded to make durable, long-lasting, and returnable dunnage systems. The systems are made from recycled and recyclable plastic. An effective reusable plastic pallet program can reduce costs, drive sustainability, and optimize a company’s supply chain. They are resistant to acids, fats, solvents, and odors. When dealing with returnable dunnage, it is important to cut down on return shipping space by allowing the pallets to nest or collapse. These pallets are lighter than hardwood pallets, saving on freight costs.</p><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/536bccd0e4b0aacd94e5e288/t/5cf8121ae9edeb0001ea927c/1559761438953/Screen+Shot+2019-06-05+at+3.01.40+PM.png?format=750w" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-05 at 3.01.40 PM.png"><p><strong>Metal Pallets:</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Metal pallets are significantly heavier than wood or plastic pallets, but they certainly have their place. When product contamination, fire suppression, or disposal costs are a concern, a steel or aluminum pallet can be a great alternative to wood or plastic. They offer unsurpassed strength, fire resistance, and the ability to be cleaned and reused indefinitely which makes them ideal for supply chain loops. Metal items are better in the long run cost-wise because they can be used for longer periods of time without maintenance or failure. Keep in mind, however, that it is more expensive to fix a metal pallet than a wooden pallet, but this cost is offset by the lower amount of maintenance required by a metal pallet. Metal pallets also offer more structurally sound design capabilities and consistency than wooden or plastic pallets. And like plastic pallets, they can be collapsible, non-collapsible, and even nestable (but this is not as common with metal).</p><p style="text-align: start">It’s important to consider your palletization system to further ensure your package makes it to its final destination efficiently and safely.

      '<p>In a word, <strong>very!</strong></p><p>Metal is the most recycled material in the world and metal packaging can increase food shelf life, decreasing waste. Metal recycling allows for a reduced carbon footprint, as well as reducing the use of natural resources.</p><p>Recycling scraps helps reduce the amount of energy being used, since melting down already processed metal requires less energy than processing raw ore.</p><p>Cradle to cradle is a concept that follows a product from creation, transportation, use, eventual disposal, and recycle. Because metal does not degrade over time, over ⅔ of all the aluminum ever produced is still in existence and usable today. This means that metals are permanently available and can go through the closed loop or circular economy of a cradle to cradle life cycle indefinitely. A steel can once used for soup could one day be part of your new car. Recycling metal saves water, money, energy, fuels, and other resources associated with producing metals.</p><p>Canned food has the longest shelf life of any packaged food. Because shelf stable cans eliminate the need for refrigeration, only 1% of canned food goes to waste. If you buy a package of meat at the deli, it will spoil in a matter of days even if left in the refrigerator. If not consumed, not only has the food been wasted, but the time, money, effort, and resources spent on production, packaging, and transporting the product have also been wasted. In contrast, canned goods remain viable for years. Canned meat left in the pantry for a month is perfectly edible and safe. Increasing shelf life by canning helps to eliminate needless waste.</p><p>Metal packaging is easily separated by consumers or industrial recycling centers that use magnets for sorting—the labels can easily be removed. 66% of steel packaging and 50% of aluminum packaging is recycled; metal can be recycled indefinitely without losing its integrity.</p><p>With more than 80 million tons of steel recycled each year, steel ranks number one as the most recycled packaging material. Steel scrap is highly valued, and, with economic incentives, it is easy to see why so many people choose to recycle it. By recycling one ton of steel over 3,000 pounds of iron ore, 1,600 pounds of coal, and 260 pounds of limestone are saved. Due to natural properties, steel manufacturing uses less energy and creates lower emissions than aluminum.</p><p>But steel scrap is not just recycled into more cans—a recycled steel can may go on to be a kitchen appliance, building, a car, or even a can again. Here are some statistics on the use of steel:</p><ul><li><p>50% to producing buildings and infrastructures</p></li><li><p>16% to mechanical equipment</p></li><li><p>13% to automobiles</p></li><li><p>11% to metal products such as furniture and packaging</p></li><li><p>5% to transportation such as rail cars and boats</p></li><li><p>3% to electrical equipment</p></li><li><p>2% to household appliances</p></li></ul><p>All of these items can be recycled and reproduced!</p><p>The lightweight yet strong nature of aluminum lowers shipping costs and fuel consumption. Aluminum walls can also be thinned during the can making process which reduces the volume of metal used and makes the shipped product lighter, reducing carbon emissions as more metal can be shipped per trip. When its highly recyclable nature is also considered, aluminum becomes a very attractive material.</p><p>Although steel is the most recycled material in the world, aluminums life cycle energy consumption boasts 20% less than that of steel. Even when new aluminum needs to be produced, the energy expended to make it is constantly decreasing. In fact, energy requirements for producing new aluminum is down more than 25% since 1995 and the aluminum industry as a whole has brought its carbon footprint down nearly 40%.</p><p>Metal packaging has cut food waste, energy waste, and helped to reduce the overall carbon footprint that we as humans leave. And with continuous innovation, metal will become more and more sustainable!</p><p>Enroll in<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/glass-metal-packaging/">Metal Packaging</a> to learn more!</p>',

      '<p>Many businesses use palletization optimizing softwares to automate calculations of how to best maximize their pallet loading efficiency. Let’s look at two very popular palletization software programs and what they offer.</p><p>Cape Pack is a packaging software that allows you to do a complete manufacturing walkthrough—all the way from primary product packaging to shipping. With Cape Pack, there are a few options for tackling a packaging challenge. You can go from product to package, package to shipping container, or product to shipping container.</p><p>If you choose to go from product to shipping container you can select the shape of your product. For example, if you have a square bottle you can select that, enter your length, width, height, and weight. This will then suggest a primary package that will be formed around your product.</p><p>Next, the secondary package dimensions are determined and Cape Pack picks out different formations that fit your primary package and give you percentages on area used in the secondary package. Following this, you can choose a pallet size, height of the pallet stack, view overhang options, and determine how much weight you would like on the pallet.</p><p>Once your requirements are noted, the software runs through many different stacking patterns that can be created from your parameters and calculates the different surface area / volume percentages used. After this is calculated, you can determine what kind of shipping container you prefer, which is almost always a 53-foot container. The software then shows the most efficient ways to load the pallets into the container.</p><p>TOPS PRO is another packaging design software, similar to Cape Pack. With this software you can determine the package size, arrangement, pallet configuration, stacking strength recommendations, and truck placement.</p><p>The four steps to running a product from start to finish on TOPS PRO are:</p><ol><li><p>Product Sizing: Enter the dimensions of your product for any shape to see a 3D rendering.</p></li><li><p>Ship Case or Carton Design: Users can create their own custom tray using the TOPS’ CASY (Create a Shape Yourself) option.</p></li><li><p>Pallet Configuration: TOPS PRO automatically generates different pallet patterns to help with shipping costs and optimal structure.</p></li><li><p>Container or Truck Optimization: This shows the most optimized way to palletize homogeneous products and handles floor spacing options to help minimize cost.</p></li></ol><p>TOPS Pro will also show mixed pallets for club stores, as well as a stacking analysis. The analysis shows calculations for the load results on boxes and box types based on the inputs from the user in the first step.</p><p>Pallet optimization is an important step in the packaging lifecycle. Don’t struggle through it on your own. A palletization program can make your life easier and your shipping more efficient, as well as save you time and money. The right software can bring you confidence by sorting through the options and selecting the most optimized solution based on your shipping container, pallet, and carrier requirements.</p><p>To learn more, head on over to our Corrugated Containers course&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/corrugated-containers">https://packagingschool.com/courses/corrugated-containers</a>.</p>',

As I set out to whip up a quick blog post about the correlation between the two, I quickly realized that there is only one thing to write about—the candy.</p><p>It’s the most important part of Halloween, in my opinion. Debate surrounds the origin of the begging-for-candy-from-strangers aspect of the holiday, but trick-or-treating has been a Halloween tradition in the United States and other countries for more than a century.</p><p>Packaging, at its simplest level, is material used to wrap or protect goods. And in the case of trick or treating, the means by which you carry your candy could be considered packaging right?! (Just go with me on this one.) We use a bag/basket/box to protect those most sacred goods of the night. It is the packaging for ALL of our Halloween treats. But, getting around to our topic of debate, what is the BEST way to protect and transport these precious goods—pillowcase or iconic plastic bucket?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PILLOWCASE</strong></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> Pillowcases are big and can hold oodles and oodles of candy.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> Pillowcases are not that festive and are sometimes strained from overuse.</p><p><strong>PLASTIC BUCKETS</strong></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>They are very festive and you can choose one that compliments your costume.

Policies and corporate standards are pushing companies to pick up on more sustainable practices in order to reduce their impact on the environment, create less waste, and have a better sustainable footprint.</p><p>People often see sustainability as implementing ways to better recycle products, but this isn’t what true sustainability means. True sustainability is working to promote the use of tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/certifications/get-to-know-csp">LCA</a> in order to lower the ecological footprint the company has on the environment. It’s important for companies to take a closer look at the materials they are using and how that is affecting the world around them. Even the little things can cause a trickle that substantially increases or decreases our environmental footprint.</p><p><strong>1. Durability</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">For a company to reduce its environmental footprint, there are a few key factors that need to be considered. The first one is durability. Having a durable material can affect a number of things that promote less waste. A stiffer and stronger material supports downgauging and also allows for converters to cut through the material so there is less waste, and in turn, less damage to the product. With more durability, the package can be smaller because less material is used and can support itself in order to protect the product from outside damage. It is important for companies to choose materials that can be efficiently processed and produce better output. Sometimes it\'s not just the material that needs to be observed.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>2. Processability</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">In terms of plastics, it may be an outdated extruder that causes resin waste or molds that could be made better to reduce the amount of scrap. In evaluating processability, a company could potentially save on energy and waste while also reducing material costs.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>3. Recyclability</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Using materials that are recyclable is an easy way for companies to reduce their footprint by reducing the number of natural resources being used. Using these materials also entices consumers to buy your product in an effort to support the growing "green" trend.</p><p style="text-align: start">To learn more about sustainable packaging, check out our newest certificate program, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/certifications/get-to-know-csp">The Certificate of Sustainable Packaging (CSP)</a>.</p>',

      '<p><strong>The Four-Pack is the New Six-Pack&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you’ve taken a walk down the beer aisle recently, you may have noticed a packaging changeup—where customary six-packs once sat, four-packs now sit in their place. All throughout our grocery stores, there seems to be a downsizing trend—<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GdtZJhurnc">less potato chips and more air in our chip bags</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>(also known as<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>slack-fill), laundry detergent bottles seem to be getting smaller, and even the chocolate bars in the checkout line are shedding some ounces. Although an argument could be made for malicious intent turning our six-packs into four-packs, there’s actually solid reasoning behind the packaging shift.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>When did the trend start?</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Most four-pack cans are craft beer—you can still get Budweiser or Miller in a six-pack. The rise of local breweries and their need for distinction may have been what prompted the four-pack trend. "Some trace the four-pack’s rise to 2013, when craft beer fanatics were lining up outside Vermont brewery The Alchemist to buy its Heady Topper IPA, one of the first beers sold in 16-ounce four-packs."&nbsp; It was an easy train to jump on and most of the craft breweries did.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Why did it start trending?</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Three factors are behind the trend: differentiation, cans, and sampling.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong><em>Differentiation</em></strong>:<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>Small brewers need to differentiate themselves from the popular six-pack of mainstream competitors. Catching the consumer’s eye on a shelf full of known and trusted brands like Budweiser, Miller, and Coors is no easy task. Craft brewers needed something disruptive—something that would stand out, and the four-pack does just that.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong><em>Can vs. Bottle</em></strong>:<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>It isn’t just popular brands vying for attention—craft breweries are everywhere these days, which means there’s a lot of competition from other craft brewers. On a glass bottle, you are pretty much limited to printing on the label. Cans utilize the entire can, opening the door for more eye-catching designs than bottles. Another win for cans is their practicality. They’re easy to carry around without worrying about dropping one and breaking it. Cans also shield the liquid from light more efficiently than glass and the problem of oxygen seeping through the cap on a glass bottle is eliminated.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong><em>Sampling</em></strong>:<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>The lower amount of cans allows for more "sampling." Craft brewers like being known for their own distinct flavors—meaning you don’t always know what you are going to get with a craft beer. It seems easier to commit (mentally) to a four-pack rather than a six-pack of traditional beer where you know exactly what it will taste like. In other words, someone who has never tried a specific craft beer will be more likely to buy a four-pack to test it out and see if they like it.</p><p style="text-align: start">Speaking of testing things out, did you know that we sell our courses a la carte?</p><p style="text-align: start">While we offer an amazing<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/certificates/">twelve-course certificate program</a>, you can also purchase<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/all_courses/">individual courses</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>that meet your specific packaging learning needs.

      "<p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley&nbsp;</strong></span><br><span >I'm here with the great Dr. Suggs. Dr. Suggs was invited to judge the Tube Council's Tube of the Year Awards. I mean, look at all these tubes. It is incredible—the amount of innovations, the different materials that are being presented here, the different functions, the different way everything came together.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >Categories from personal care, dentistry, industrial. . . We're going to talk through some of the tubes that were more of standouts for us this year.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Narrator</strong></span><br><span style=\"color: rgb(29, 28, 29)\">In this video, you will learn about some current material trends in tubes, you will be able to define PCR, and understand why it's important. We will also cover some popular barrier types for packaging tubes, including EVOH. We will discuss tube recycling, and the way it is communicated on packages, and lastly, we will highlight some unique tube designs that are setting a new standard for the future.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >One thing that really stood out to me was that companies are blending polyethylene, the different densities of polyethylene, actually. We have typically, I think—we’ve got low-density and high-density polyethylene. So you think about those grocery bags of high-density polyethylene. But here, in a lot of these, we're mixing together high-density and medium-density polyethylene, as well as low-density polyethylene and medium-density polyethylene, just to have that, just another way to get a little bit less weight. Awesome. So also a big theme that we saw was a lot of PCR, and that is post-consumer recycled content. Which is great because we're taking materials that are packaging materials, collecting them, and then putting them back into packaging, which is what I think packaging should do—it should become more packaging. And we've got some great examples here on this one in particular, 70% post-consumer recycled content—varies across the board. One thing that I'd like to point out here is that this particular design uses raw aluminum, and it's not that bad.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >No, we kind of like it!</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >I mean, I like aluminum. I like aluminum a lot. And they didn't put a print layer on it. They didn't coat it with a bunch of stuff. I mean, I just think aluminum, it just generally feels nice, and they use that raw form for the package type.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >Tell us about the back of it. Do they tell us any specifics on how we actually should recycle it?</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >They do. And they give it in . . . this is not a US-based package, but they clearly designate this as aluminum and to recycle into that aluminum feedstock.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >Awesome. Love it. We're talking a lot about EVOH barriers—that seems like a big category or a big barrier item for a lot of these personal care items. Why do you think that is, Dr. Hurley, and do we need that in the future?</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >I thought it was interesting that in these laminate structures that the print area used that EVOH material, and so they applied it directly onto the base substrate, which is typically polyethylene. However, there was a really interesting tube. This is not a branded one, but this uses a polyethylene with an aluminum, and they claim this is EVOH-free because aluminum has some great barrier properties as well. But combining here, we thought this was pretty innovative.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >Yeah. And they actually make a point to say that compared to the tube laminate, so also just comparing these two, this one is just . . . I mean, obviously, they're going to say it's better, but they use a recycle-class criteria to categorize it. So that's fun. And again, like Dr. Hurley said, it's only made of a mono-material.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >So, another topic on tubes is recycling. And I know it's a contentious topic and trying to understand—can you actually recycle these things? And what we found in this overview of tubes is that there's a lot of different claims here. I mean, obviously we have our <em>Please Recycle</em>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >It is, yes.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >When I see this I think, <em>Please Tell Me How to Recycle It</em>, because you're not telling me what's going on here. So we saw quite a bit of this, just the chasing arrows saying, <em>Please Recycle Me</em>.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >And so, Dr. Hurley, for that one, too, we know that one, (Dr. Hurley and I know), that one's made of PCR, but the consumer does not know that.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >It's correct. And even though this is great, it's using a high level of post-consumer recycled content, it is not in a format that anyone's going to recycle because they just don't know what it is. And then we have things that may have some conflicting messaging. So, we have a particular tube that it says clearly, it's using GreenBlue’s How2Recycle tile, and it says, “Hey, this is not recyclable.” But then we have TerraCycle on top of it. And TerraCycle, it's a program that they will come up and pick this up for you and repurpose it in some way—maybe refill it, or it's a program in order to dispose of the product when it's done.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >But actually, have you used TerraCycle? Is it easy? Is it accessible for the normal consumer out there?</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >I mean, it was a long time ago when I had interactions with it, but I know that it's limited in certain places in the country, but it may have expanded out from now. But there is that particular end-of-life claim on this package. Then we have some pretty bold ones where not just does it say to recycle it, it goes into detail saying that this is a polyethylene tube— it says a number two plastic—and go ahead and recycle it. So, it's telling you specifically to do it. And it even has the cap. And it's telling you exactly what to do with the cap.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >And then this one also does that with LDPE. It tells us exactly it's number four. We know that's the resin code, and we like to see that.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >This one, on the other hand, instead of taking the content and different densities, this one took some structural innovations. They go through and talk through how micron-thin this laminate is able to be. They also mix the densities of the material. So, it's really a structural innovation. My favorite part here is that they created the most lightweight closure system I've ever seen. So they took time to drill out all of the unnecessary components of the closure. And just showing some examples here of how these could look. I mean, it's pretty interesting. I mean, all of this has been removed. So they core it out. If you think about a clock, there's maybe like 35 degrees that's left on this closure. And it fits really well. I mean, it's pretty incredible, the stability of this and how it opens and closes and functions just like something that might be three times the weight. So, I thought this was a really interesting innovation.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >Yeah, and apparently that closure, they have cited that it's 60% lighter than other closures on the market. So again, pretty cool innovation for design. I don't know if we'll see that more in the future.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >Yeah. So when I think about concluding all of this, it just talks about how important packaging education is. If you don't understand materials, you're at a huge loss. Because not just the material type here, but the densities of those materials, and then the production processes of these materials. If you want a particular barrier, we're going to go the lamination route. If you're going to be really looking at mixing these different densities of materials, we're going to go the coextrusion route. And then the decoration and to the materiality of where the materials came from, and then engineering those materials to perform specific functions. I mean, tubes has it all.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Suggs</strong></span><br><span >I know. And this also reminds me that designing tubes and all packaging, for that matter, is just a multitude of stakeholders that have to be involved. When you think about this, Dr. Hurley and I have talked about production, we've talked about design elements, we've talked a big part about sustainability—that means that so many people have to be involved in these discussions. So, that's why at the Packaging School, we talk about all of these different elements for that holistic understanding of packaging.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Dr. Hurley</strong></span><br><span >Absolutely, Dr. Suggs.</span></p>",

The program is run by text input prompts, and the images are generated based on the inputs. Users, who access the platform through a Discord account, enter a chat room to generate images.</p><p>Midjourney can be an effective tool in the ideation and brainstorming stage of the packaging design process. For example, if your brand is looking to redesign a packaging system with new brand colors, Midjourney can generate mockups to kick off the creative process.</p><p>Midjourney has a number of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/plans">subscription opportunities</a>, ranging from $10 USD a month for Midjourney basic to $120 USD a month for Midjourney Mega.</p><p>To use Midjourney, you have to create a Discord account and subscribe to one of the plans linked above. Once you have access, you must join a channel (newbies), and then you can start generating images in seconds. In order to enter a text to image prompt, you must type "<strong>/imagine</strong>" and then your desired prompt.</p><p>For the sake of this blog, we will focus on the prompt: "innovative orange juice packaging." Here is an example of what was generated from Midjourney.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/mitchweb333midjourney2.webp"><p><span style="color: rgb(25, 27, 35)">Midjourney lets you make different versions from one prompt, which you can customize by choosing U1, U2, U3, or U4.</span> The image above was created by selecting U4 from the initial prompt (See first image in blog) and then selecting "V4," which created 4 new variations similar to the original U4.</p><p>Additionally, Midjourney does not seem overwhelmed by lengthy text prompts. Looking to breathe some new life into my packaging design skills, I decided to try a long text prompt to see how the tool responded. I entered the following prompt:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>/imagine</strong> [innovative and sustainable orange juice packaging made of orange peels]</p><p>As with all Midjourney prompts, it produced 4 examples in under a minute; the following image was one of my favorites.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/innovativeorangejuiceMIDJOURNEY.webp"><p>Midjourney is a powerful tool to generate creative mockups for packaging designs. While it is the most complex tool to use of the five covered in this article, it is also fairly easy to figure out after spending some time on the platform.</p><h2 class="font-bold"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fotor.com/features/ai-product-design/?sscid=11k8_12o8ik">Fotor AI</a></h2><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 2.39.11 PM.png"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fotor.com/features/ai-product-design/?sscid=11k8_12o8ik">Fotor</a> is an AI tool designed to aid in the product design and development process, providing a user-friendly platform to generate an array of innovative packaging designs in seconds.</p><p>I decided to explore Fotor\'s platform and run a quick test on its effectiveness in generating clear and relevant images from text-based prompts. As you can see in the picture above, you type a text-based input in the top left—I entered "innovative orange juice packaging"—and images are generated in the middle section, with all images archived on the right.</p><p>In the free version, you are allotted credits to explore the platform (each query generating 2 images costs 2 credits). I found Fotor a user-friendly option and a great way to explore how AI can aid in your packaging development process.</p><p>Look below to see the image generated in just seconds with the simple prompt: "innovative orange juice packaging."</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/fotor-ai-2024021214501 (1).jpg"><p>Fotor includes a number of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fotor.com/pricing/">pricing plans</a> including a free version (which I used for the design above) and Fotor Pro and Fotor Pro+ versions, priced at $3.33 USD a month and $7.49 USD a month, respectively.</p><h2 class="font-bold"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.canva.com/magic-home">Canva Magic Studio Text to Image Software</a></h2><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-02-12 at 2.58.53 PM.png"><p>Canva\'s<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.canva.com/magic-home"> <u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Magic Studio</span></u></a> has a number of accessible and efficient AI tools for designers. From software that transforms text to images and videos to writing tools, Canva Magic Studio is a great place to start when looking into how AI can help assist your packaging design process.</p><p>For the sake of packaging design inspiration, I decided to explore Canva\'s <em>Text to Image</em> feature and use the same prompt I used for the Fotor test:</p><p>"innovative orange juice packaging"</p><p>Canva generated 4 designs in less than a minute—it also provides an option to generate again if you are not happy with the output. Each query generates 4 images to choose from. Similar to Fotor, Canva\'s <em>Text to Image</em> AI tool in their Magic Studio suite is a great tool to begin incorporating AI into your packaging design workflow.</p><p>You can access Canva\'s AI tools through the free version of Canva, making it an easy option to explore if your team already includes Canva in your day-to-day marketing and content creation.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/orangejuicepackagingAItest.png"><h2 class="font-bold"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://new.express.adobe.com/?category=generative-ai">Adobe Express Generative AI (Text to Image)</a></h2><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Screenshot 2024-02-13 at 1.20.57 PM.png"><p>Similar to Canva, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://new.express.adobe.com/"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Adobe Express</span></u></a> has a number of generative AI tools from <em>Text to Image</em> to <em>Generative Fill</em> to <em>Text to Template</em>, and more.</p><p>The Adobe <em>Text to Image</em> tool is quite similar to that of Canva, although Adobe\'s tool has more stylistic customization. As you can see in the image above, once you input the prompt, you can choose "Content Type" ranging from the following:</p><ul><li><p>None</p></li><li><p>Photo (as pictured above)</p></li><li><p>Graphic</p></li><li><p>Art</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, Adobe\'s tool allows one to choose from an array of styles including chaotic, digital art, synthwave, and more. One interesting component that relates to packaging design is the ability to choose material type! For example, you can choose from options like layered paper, metal, fabric, and more.</p><p>This aspect in particular differentiates Adobe from other options explored in this blog, allowing packaging designers to envision how different materials can come together as unique designs in seconds. Interested in a multi-material packaging system? Adobe allows you to choose a number of different materials and combine them in prompts, leading to interesting and insightful design mockups.</p><p>To stay on theme, I decided to run the same prompt—"innovative orange juice packaging"—on Adobe\'s tool. The results were funky and fun, which makes sense as Adobe is one of the premier digital art tools available on the market.</p><p>The image below is one of the outputs to the prompt. Due to Adobe\'s "art focus," I would recommend diving into the prompt options and focusing on "Photo" (as compared to "Graphic" or "Art") and exploring how you can input different material types.</p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Untitled (34).png"><p>Just out of curiosity, I decided to test the limits of this tool—inputting some of the parameters I mentioned above. Let\'s say I am a packaging designer tasked with helping generate ideas / mockups for an innovative orange juice packaging system made primarily of metal that taps into nostalgia marketing trends.</p><p>Here is the output when using the same text prompt—"innovative orange juice packaging"—but also selecting "Metal" as "Materials" in the <em>Styles</em> section, and selecting "Nostalgic" in "Concepts" in the <em>Styles</em> section.

      '<p>Ever tried to open a bottle of pills or a cleaning product only to feel like you’re solving a Rubik\'s Cube? While this may be frustrating, child-resistant closures (CRC) are the superheroes of packaging, keeping curious little fingers away from potentially harmful substances and remaining accessible to adults. They\'re like tiny fortresses, designed to thwart the most determined of tiny hands and give peace of mind to parents everywhere. So, let’s take a closer look at how child resistant closures have evolved and their current testing methods.</p><h3 class="font-bold">Child-resistant closures have a fascinating history, marked by concerns over child safety and regulatory efforts to mitigate accidental poisonings. Here’s a condensed timeline<sup>1,2,3,4</sup>:<br><br></h3><p><strong>Early 20th Century:</strong> As household products became more common, so did accidental poisonings, particularly among children. Bottles often had simple screw caps that were easy for children to open.</p><p><strong>1936:</strong> A significant event occurred when the American Medical Association (AMA) published a study highlighting the dangers of accidental poisonings, especially among children. This spurred discussions on the need for safer packaging.</p><p><strong>1957:</strong> The first child-resistant packaging, known as the "Palm \'n Turn" closure, was invented by Dr. Henri Breault, a Canadian pediatrician. It required a combination of squeezing and turning to open, making it difficult for young children to access its contents.</p><p><strong>1970:</strong> The Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) was passed in the United States, mandating child-resistant packaging for various household substances, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and household chemicals. This legislation significantly boosted the development and adoption of CRC.</p><p><strong>1973:</strong> The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) was established in the US, further emphasizing the importance of product safety, including child-resistant packaging standards.</p><p><strong>1984:</strong> The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published ISO 8317, a standard for child-resistant packaging, providing guidelines for manufacturers worldwide.</p><p><strong>2002:</strong> The European Union implemented regulations requiring child-resistant packaging for certain pharmaceutical products, aligning with existing standards in the US and other regions.</p><p><strong>Modern Innovations:</strong> Over the years, CRC technology has continued to evolve, with advancements such as push-and-turn caps, squeeze-and-turn caps, blister packs, and other innovative designs aimed at balancing safety with accessibility for adults.</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the testing component of child-resistant closures.&nbsp;</p><p>Child-resistant closures (CRC) undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet specified safety standards. Two prominent organizations, ASTM International and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have established testing protocols for CRC. Here\'s an overview of the testing methods commonly used:</p><p>ASTM Standards<sup>5,6,7</sup>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>ASTM D3475:</strong> This standard outlines the test method for measuring the torque required to open and close child-resistant packages. It involves applying a specific torque to the closure and measuring the force required to open it.</p></li><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>ASTM D7860:</strong> This standard specifies the test method for determining the force required to remove or disengage child-resistant caps from bottles or containers. It evaluates the strength of the closure\'s engagement mechanism.</p></li><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>ASTM F2097:</strong> This standard focuses on the testing of blister packaging to determine its effectiveness as child-resistant packaging. It involves testing the force required to push the product through the blister and into the container.</p></li></ul><p>ISO Standards1,8,9:</p><ul><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>ISO 8317:</strong> This standard specifies requirements and test methods for child-resistant packaging. It outlines procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of closures in preventing access by young children while allowing easy access for adults.</p></li><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>ISO 13127:</strong> This standard provides guidelines for the testing of reclosable child-resistant packaging. It includes methods for assessing the ease of opening and reclosing the packaging while maintaining child resistance.</p></li><li><p><strong>ISO 17480:</strong> This standard specifies test methods for the assessment of the ease of opening and reclosing child-resistant packaging for pharmaceutical products. It covers various closure types, including push-and-turn caps and squeeze-and-turn caps.</p></li></ul><p>These testing standards ensure that child-resistant closures are effective in preventing access by children while remaining accessible to adults. Manufacturers typically conduct these tests during the development and production phases to certify compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)&nbsp; . Also of note—each state has specific requirements for child-resistant closures, but most of these rules fall under the jurisdiction of the Poison Prevention Act (PPPA) standards created decades ago.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Interestingly and maybe obviously, for packaging to meet the CPSC’s child-resistant standard, it must be subjected to real-world testing with children and adults. Packaging must be tested under normal conditions by a panel of children in three different age groups: 42–44 months,&nbsp; 45–48 months, and 49–51 months.10 For the packaging to successfully pass child-resistant testing, at least 80% of the children involved in the test should not be able to open the package throughout the entire ten-minute testing period. Within these ten minutes, the children are instructed on how to open the package and that they may use their teeth (like real life, huh?).<sup>11</sup></p><p>Child-resistant testing often involves statistical analysis to determine the effectiveness of the packaging. The number of children who can open the packaging within a specified time frame, such as the first five minutes, is a crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of the packaging. By setting thresholds for the number of children who can open the packaging before it is deemed a failure, regulators can ensure that the packaging provides a reasonable level of protection against accidental ingestion by children.<sup>12</sup></p><p>As with most packaging, child-resistant closures come in a variety of designs—each carefully crafted and tested. Let’s take a look at some common closure styles and their typical applications: <sup>13,14,15</sup></p><ul><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>Push-and-Turn (Twist) Closure:</strong> This style requires the user to simultaneously push down and twist the cap to open the container. It often features a safety lock mechanism that engages when the cap is closed, requiring deliberate action to unlock it. Push-and-turn closures are commonly used for pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medications, personal care products, and household chemical products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Squeeze-and-Turn Closure:</strong> Similar to push-and-turn closures, squeeze-and-turn closures require the user to squeeze the sides of the cap while twisting to open the container. This design offers an additional level of child resistance by incorporating a squeezing action. Squeeze-and-turn closures are frequently found on pharmaceutical bottles, containers for liquid medications, and household chemicals.</p></li><li style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13)"><p><strong>Flip-Top Closure:</strong> These closures typically involve a mechanism that requires a specific combination of actions to open, which can be challenging for young children to figure out but manageable for adults. These mechanisms often include pressing down and simultaneously flipping a cap or pushing and twisting motions.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>And there are some hacks out there as well. For folks that have no need for these child-resistant measures or have increased loss of dexterity in their hands, the traditional Rx bottle closure can be flipped and put on backwards. This action makes the pill bottle no longer childproof and a whole lot easier to open. While this is not a universal action (from our research), we have found that pharmacies will provide snap-off/on caps as well when requested.&nbsp;</p><p>CRCs are typically made from a variety of materials, each chosen for its suitability in providing both child resistance and functionality. Some common materials used for CRCs include:<sup>16,17,18,19</sup></p><ul><li><p>Polypropylene (PP): PP is a widely used thermoplastic polymer known for its durability, chemical resistance, and versatility. It\'s commonly used in CRC closures due to its ability to withstand repeated opening and closing cycles without deforming or losing its child-resistant properties. PP closures are often used for pharmaceutical packaging, household chemical products, and food containers.</p></li><li><p>High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE): HDPE is a strong, rigid plastic known for its resistance to chemicals and impact. It\'s commonly used in CRC closures for its durability and ability to maintain child-resistant features over time. HDPE closures are often used for products such as prescription medication bottles, household chemicals, and industrial containers.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Metal: Some CRC closures utilize metal components, such as aluminum or steel, to provide additional strength and security. Metal closures are often used in combination with plastic components to create a child-resistant locking mechanism. Metal closures are commonly found on products such as prescription medication vials, aerosol cans, and certain types of food packaging.</p></li><li><p>Blends and Composites: Manufacturers may also use blends of different polymers or composite materials to achieve specific performance requirements for CRC closures. These blends may offer enhanced durability, chemical resistance, or aesthetic properties compared to single-material closures.</p></li><li><p>Flexible Packaging Materials with Zipper Mechanisms: Child-safe zippers and flexible packaging are essential components in ensuring the safety of children around potentially hazardous products. These are typically made from high-barrier films, mult-layer structures, and some companies have been testing the use of PCR in both the film and the zipper closures.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, child-resistant closures are indispensable safeguards, designed to protect children from accidental ingestion of harmful substances while allowing easy access for adults. Through innovative designs and rigorous testing, CRCs ensure safety without compromising convenience. These closures, along with child-safe zippers and flexible packaging, represent a vital aspect of product safety, promoting peace of mind for caregivers and manufacturers alike.</p>',

The project has an evolutionary direction, in order to continuously develop the main product line, while focusing on improving and reengineering the 3L pouch.</p><p>The student’s strategy was to focus on shoppers who are looking for more efficient and sustainable ways of consuming, but they also wanted to figure out a way to prevent excess waste. They came up with a product that is a concentrated formula of liquid detergent, which allows for the replacement of the 3L pouch with a 500ml pouch, as the original detergent is diluted to meet the quantity of washes in the 3L pouch.</p><p>Compared to the 3L pouch, there is less packaging material and less transportation necessary to deliver the same amount of washes, ultimately leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions. An innovation that could work to both differentiate the brand and also make progress on sustainability commitments.</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>The student’s testimonial:</strong></h3><p>“<em>The CMPM journey was an opportunity to rediscover the packaging world. It provided me with a full picture from the planning to the implementation of a new product, going through materials, processes, sustainability, consumer behavior, and more. So, now it’s time to create new packaging solutions!</em>”&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Take Your Career to the Next Level with the CMPM</h3><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/1.18.24CMPMclickthrough02v2.png"><p>Since we launched the CMPM in 2017, we have trained hundreds of packaging professionals in various places in the industry—from Fortune 500 companies to small family-owned packaging operations.</p><p>The CMPM is a cohort-based program that is led by our very own Julie Rice Suggs, PhD!

      '<p>More than ever, today’s consumers are driving change and disruption in the packaging industry. As sustainability becomes the number one moral imperative of the 21st century, it will also become an essential ingredient for long-term success. Done well, sustainability effectuates transformative change that spurs innovation, delivers bottom-line value, and presents an opportunity for a competitive edge.</p><p>According to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/25/2253076/0/en/Sustainable-Packaging-Market-to-reach-USD-470-3-billion-by-2027-Report-by-Market-Research-Future-MRFR.html">Markets Research Future report</a>, the global sustainable packaging market is expected to reach $470.3 billion by 2027. As a result, investment in green technologies is booming. Across the supply chain, companies are focusing on solutions to minimize their ecological footprint, and in the era of digitalization, megatrends such as big data will prove useful in generating insights that foster sustainability and change the future of packaging.</p><p>Implementing change, however, can present its own set of unique challenges, and organizations will need to be strategic in selecting their best avenue for success. So, what are some of the world’s innovators doing today to help drive the sustainability of their packaging? Find out below.</p><p><strong>Eliminating Ocean Plastics</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Every year, eight million tons of plastics pollute the ocean on top of the estimated 150 million tons currently contaminating our seas. If we continue on the current track, there will be more plastic than fish in the sea (by weight) by 2050, according to a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/plastics/overview#:~:text=Designing%20out%20plastic%20pollution&amp;text=We%20must%20change%20how%20we,than%20fish%20in%20the%20oceans.">2016 study conducted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>.</p><p style="text-align: start">In 2018, value-driven brands started to take action by working towards 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging by 2025. The list of 11 companies, announced at last year’s World Economic Forum by the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a> included Amcor, Évian, L’Oréal, M&amp;S, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Mars, Unilever, Ecover, Walmart, and Werner &amp; Mertz. Other large companies, such as McDonald’s and Dell, have also made notable pledges to use sustainable packaging.</p><p style="text-align: start"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dell.com/learn/bm/en/bmcorp1/corp-comm/bamboo-packaging">Dell</a> has incorporated bamboo, wheat straw, and mushrooms into its packaging for years, and they set a goal of 100 percent sustainable packaging by 2020. In early 2017, Dell launched the world’s first commercial-scale, ocean-bound plastics supply chain.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Lightweighting</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Food and beverage manufacturers have been placing increasing emphasis on creating more sustainable packaging that uses less material and reduces costs throughout the supply chain. This process, known as lightweighting, is done by either replacing packaging material with a lighter weight alternative or cutting down the amount of material used.</p><p style="text-align: start">In recent years, beverage companies have begun transitioning from glass bottles to PET for their lightweight characteristics and recyclability. Other brands, like Michigan-based company <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://boxedwaterisbetter.com/">Boxed Water</a>, have turned to carton-based packaging to support sustainability efforts and differentiate themselves from the competition.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Making it Edible</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Edible packaging—the ultimate in zero-waste packaging. Whether it’s Icelandic product designer <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dezeen.com/2016/03/20/ari-jonsson-algae-biodegradable-water-bottles-iceland/">Ari Jonsson’s</a> algae water bottle or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://thedieline.com/blog/2016/5/9/kfc-edible-bowls#:~:text=KFC%20in%20India%20has%20released,item%20that%20is%20India%2Dspecific.">KFC India’s edible tortilla bowl</a>, packaging that you can eat is revolutionizing the food industry. We’re likely to see more innovative designs as, according to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.9b01251#:~:text=According%20to%20Transparency%20Market%20Research,worth%20almost%20%242%20billion%20worldwide.">Transparency Market Research</a>, demand for edible packaging could increase on average by 6.9% yearly until 2024.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Improving Bioplastics</strong></p><p style="text-align: start">Finding solutions for the world’s plastic problem is an uphill battle. More than 18 trillion pounds of plastic have been produced to date and as more research surfaces, consumers and manufacturers are left clambering for an eco-friendly alternative. Could bioplastics be the answer?</p><p style="text-align: start">According to a new report from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.smithers.com/resources/2017/apr/global-bioplastics-for-packaging-market-forecasts#:~:text=CAGR%20to%202022-,Global%20bioplastics%20for%20packaging%20market%20forecast%20to%20grow%20by%2017,to%20exclusive%20research%20from%20Smithers.">Smithers</a>, bioplastics currently represent a very small share of the global plastic packaging market value—but that is set to change. From 2017 to 2022, the bioplastic market will more than double in value, growing at an average rate of 17% per year, to a market value of $7.2 billion. The report explored some of the more established materials in the market including bio-PET, bio-PE, and polylactic acid (PLA).</p><p style="text-align: start">And thanks to advancements in technology, bioplastics are getting greener (by increasing the bio-based content of base polymers) and stronger.</p><p style="text-align: start">To hear first-hand insights from sustainability and packaging leaders, check out our newest certificate program <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/certifications/get-to-know-csp">the Certificate of Sustainable Packaging (CSP)</a> to learn more about sustainability in the industry.</p>',

      "<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Welcome, everybody! I'm your host Kevin Keigley, and with me today is one of my colleagues at the Packaging School, Anna—Anna Ogletree. I've known Anna for a little while and we've got to work together at the Packaging School, working on some different projects and that kind of thing.</p><p>But over the course of time, I've learned that you have an interesting obsession. And I don't know if it's an obsession like where we need to call the Discovery Channel and have them come out for an intervention, but what we have laid out here is just a portion or part of your obsession. Can you tell us what is your obsession, Anna?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> I have an obsession with collecting foreign packages, specifically food packaging.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Now how did that even begin?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> I didn't really have much obsession with packaging at all until I chose it as my major for Clemson University, and after that I just got really interested in the processes of how each type of package can be designed in different ways to be unique for each brand and each product.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So, let's start with tabs because I think those are interesting, like they're not all the same across the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> If you're from the US and most parts of the world, I guess, you're probably used to seeing a can tab that looks like this—aluminum, these are all aluminum. But I've seen a trend recently where you can add color to them; it's probably through digital printing also. This one is from a Starbucks, a coffee drink.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I've heard of Starbucks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> Yea, it's Starbucks green. I don’t know if that’s a brand . . .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yea, I am sure it is branded.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> But this is one way that can tabs can be used in the design itself to set your product apart.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yea, just another way to make that branding pop, another way to stand out from everywhere else.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> Michelob Ultra, as well as Monster energy drinks, they've got these tabs that they have a different design, they don't have the opening there; instead, they use that space to add more graphics and more of their brand.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I know on Bubly’s . . . I think they say like . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> Yeah, I have one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Oh, sorry! I'm jumping ahead of you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna: </strong>Yeah, like Kevin was saying, the Bubly drinks, sparkling waters, they have different messages and different colors for each type . . .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> . . . each flavor . . .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anna:</strong> each flavor . . . and they all say different forms of <em>hello</em>—so this says, <em>hi you</em>. This is a Red Bull can, I believe they're from Austria, so this might be an Austrian design, but I'm not sure. They have actually cut out the design of a bull . . .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> . . . so, instead of printing in that space, they actually punched out their logo. Wow, so many different options.</p><h1 class=\"font-bold\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>At the Packaging School, we’re always saying the phrase “Packaging is Awesome.” And if this is not a compelling example of that, I don’t know what is! Anna’s passion for packaging is evident when looking at the vast array of food and beverage packaging she’s gathered over the years. And we couldn’t even get to all of it in this lesson—this is part one of a series investigating Anna’s collection—so stay tuned!&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to learn more about how to approach a project with your team and leverage iterative development to build winning designs, check out our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-design-workflow\">Packaging Design Workflow</a> course today!</p>",

      '<p><strong>Pantone’s Color of the Year has been announced and the world of packaging is about to see its fair share of blue this year.</strong></p><p>Since 2000, Pantone’s Color of the Year has influenced product development and purchasing decisions in every facet of the consumer world—fashion, home furnishings, industrial design, and our personal favorites: product packaging and graphic design. All of these categories have been affected throughout the years by the chosen color, whether we’ve realized it or not. Pantone kicked off their very first Color of the Year with Cerulean Blue. I find it fascinating that at the start of the process (and millenium) they chose a blue hue, and now 20 years later, we circle back to it—this time with Classic Blue.</p><p>Just how did the experts land on Classic Blue, and what’s so influential about a Color of the Year, anyway?</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>The Science Behind It All</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">The color spectrum is part of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to humans. It’s made up of the range of wavelengths that produce colors from red to blue, and wavelengths can be anywhere between 380 and 780 nanometers. These wavelengths are perceived and interpreted by the cones within the human eye, letting us see the world in color—about <strong>10 million different colors</strong>, to be exact! (You can learn more interesting color facts in our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-design-workflow"><u>Packaging Design Workflow course</u></a>).<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>Out of millions to choose from, how does someone pick just ONE to be the trendy color of the year?</p><p style="text-align: start">They certainly don’t choose the color on a whim.</p><p style="text-align: start">"<em>The selection process requires thoughtful consideration and trend analysis to arrive at the selection each year. Pantone’s color experts at the Pantone Color Institute comb the world looking for new color influences.</em>" — <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020">Pantone</a></p><p style="text-align: start">They scour the entertainment industry, artists, fashion, all facets of design, travel destinations, new and evolving lifestyles, and socio-economic conditions. Influences are not only found in conventional styles, but may also stem from new materials, textures, and effects that impact color. Relevant social media platforms and sporting events that capture worldwide attention have an impact.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>What Does Classic Blue Represent?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">Pantone’s goal for the new decade was to highlight our desire for a dependable and stable foundation on which to build as we cross the threshold into a new era, and they believe Classic Blue does just that. "<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020">Classic Blue</a> brings a sense of peace and tranquility to the human spirit, offering refuge. Aiding concentration and bringing laser-like clarity, Classic Blue re-centers our thoughts. A reflective blue tone, Classic Blue fosters resilience." Most of us would agree that inner peace in these uncertain times is a worthy pursuit and that may lead to thoughtful reflection on the past. This calming blue shade, reminiscent of the evening sky, can be the beacon to help guide us on this path.</p><p style="text-align: start">Given the above in-depth analysis of, frankly, just a shade of blue, you might be asking—what does this have to do with packaging?</p><p style="text-align: start">Pantone believes we respond viscerally to Classic Blue—emotionally drawn to a color we can trust. This makes it an ideal shade for many applications of graphic design. A message of honesty, credibility, and reliability will connect with consumers as they peruse the many products on any given store shelf.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: start">"We are living in a time that requires trust and faith. It is this kind of constancy and confidence that is expressed by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020">PANTONE Classic Blue</a>."</p><p style="text-align: start">Companies are already using Classic Blue in their color palettes. Two of my personal favorites are<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)">&nbsp; </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.companybox.com/blog/can-you-use-pantones-2020-color-of-the-year-in-your-packaging/"><u>Sunbird Rooibos</u></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.companybox.com/blog/can-you-use-pantones-2020-color-of-the-year-in-your-packaging/"><u>Fortnum &amp; Mason</u></a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)">. </span>I guarantee the next time you are out shopping, you’ll find Classic Blue in more places than you thought.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>How to Incorporate Classic Blue</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">If you’re looking to incorporate Classic Blue into your next packaging design, good idea! You’ll be on trend, and people will know you’ve done your homework. The trick will be to do this while still differentiating yourself from the competition.</p><p style="text-align: start"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.primelinepackaging.com/classic-blue-pantone-2020/"><u>Prime Line Packaging</u></a> suggests pairing the color with textured materials like velvet, cotton canvas, vinyl, or specialty papers that will be sure to catch the consumer’s eye. Another unique take could be hot foil stamping your package to make it stand out. "The pop of metallics along with the contrast of deep blue will add a rich feel to your packaging. The foil itself will add that little bit of shine to your items, creating eye-catching pieces."&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: start">Personally, I would love a newfound sense of constancy and confidence, so I’m all behind the Classic Blue movement. It’s a wonderful color to start off the new decade as we expectantly look to where 2020 will take us. And I’m excited to revisit this blog in a year and reflect on how well Classic Blue actually did.</p><p style="text-align: start">Learn more about the human factors of packaging design in our online course at: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/leveraging-human-factors-in-packaging-design">https://packagingschool.com/courses/leveraging-human-factors-in-packaging-design</a></p>',

We live in a day and age of deadlines, efficiency, and speed. The pressure to do more, be more, and know more during our brief time here on this earth can weigh us down and make us feel like we can’t keep up. Most days, there doesn’t seem to be enough time to accomplish all we want to do.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: start">As I navigated my career, there were times when I needed to fit continuing education into the jam-packed schedule of my life. That usually meant something had to get bumped or adjusted—which is never fun. I discovered (as have many others like me) that online and self-paced educational programs make the addition of schooling about as easy as it can be. This type of education has been empowering and confidence building at key points in my career.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Teaming Up for Continuing Education</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.isbt.com/">The International Society of Beverage Technologists (ISBT)</a> and the Packaging School, two organizations that recognize the need for knowledge gathering outside of the traditional classroom methods, both offer incredible opportunities to strengthen or further an understanding of topics related to the packaging industry. The companies teamed up in 2017 to find a way to help the modern professional seeking continuing education, and the Beverage Institute by ISBT was born out of that partnership. The Beverage Institute currently offers eight e-learning courses centered on different facets of the art and science of beverage technology.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Meet Nathaniel Morrison</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">For <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmorrison1/">Nathaniel Morrison</a>, founder of Premium Herbal Products, the courses offered by ISBT were a great way for him to get up to speed when a new career opportunity presented itself: "Taking a course like this and being able to educate myself was really helpful. In my career now, owning my own business, I need to be able to get up to speed on topics I am not familiar with very quickly and troubleshoot on my own. Going through this experience gives me the confidence that I can get up to speed and deal with whatever technical issues may come up."</p><p style="text-align: start">The convenience of online learning is hard to beat when you already have multiple irons in the fire. Nathaniel said,</p><p>“<em>I like the autonomy of it—you can do it on your own time, login / log-off whenever you need to, so that was really convenient. I appreciate how it is all pre-recorded and on-demand.</em>”</p><p style="text-align: start">You can’t miss anything because all you have to do is rewind the video if there’s something you didn’t quite catch the first time. Many of the lessons in ISBT’s courses are micro lessons—short enough so you can watch one or two while you take a coffee break or wait in car line to pick up your kids.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Learning that Adapts to Your Schedule</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">Most people simply can’t afford to stop everything and make time for career-advancing education. But most people don’t want to remain stagnate in their career either. The ability to adapt online learning to your schedule and demands makes it highly desirable to those looking for a third option.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Take the Time to Make the Time</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">For me, the need to keep learning is something I’m going to foster. I’m going to carve out time to do that in whatever fashion I can. The same holds true for people like Nathaniel. We want to be better, and we want to have time to do the other things that are important to us. And thanks to companies like ISBT and the Packaging School, we don’t have to choose. Will it require a bit of discipline? Yes—but do you really need to watch <em>Parks and Rec</em> for the fourth time in two years? Nah, me either.</p><p style="text-align: start"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://packagingschool.com/all_courses/#beverage">ENROLL TODAY</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>in one of our beverage courses!</p>',

      '<p><span >With over 150 courses completed, I\'ve likely taken more tests and exams than most. Perhaps I was burnt out on testing because when I first started my teaching career, I made it a point to be anti-test and pro-projects. I considered projects to be more aligned with real-world scenarios, focusing less on memory and more on refining practical skills. </span></p><p><span >In my industry experience, apart from mandatory corporate education for liability-reduction purposes, I cannot recall being tested on the products or services I’ve worked on. I’ve learned everything through collaborative projects with colleagues and clients.</span></p><p><span >However, a few years ago, my team collaborated on an educational initiative with a large global company that fundamentally values education. They had a vast portfolio of products and struggled to determine where to begin with their curriculum. During a brainstorming session, we had a breakthrough idea: start with a test to evaluate the salesforce\'s product knowledge.</span></p><p><span >After strategically developing the exam in collaboration with product and brand leaders, we deployed it globally, resulting in over 1,000 completions from sales and marketing associates. The outcome was fascinating—the average score was 30%, a solid F.</span></p><p><span >This humbling experience underscored the need for a comprehensive curriculum and attracted more managers who self-elected to participate in the development process. We analyzed the exam results, identifying connections between associate responsibilities, product attributes, and service features. </span></p><img src="https://packmedia54032-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/public/testingHEROcmprsd.png"><p><span >This analysis established a baseline understanding of the company, driving the development of our first educational module aimed at correcting major disconnects, misconceptions, and knowledge gaps. We refined this module to take less than 20 minutes to complete.</span></p><p><span >Upon retesting the associates after their completion of the module, we saw a significant increase in scores from 30% to 80%. This success led us to develop a series of modules progressing from common to specialized training, with scores improving alongside education.</span></p><p><span >This experience transformed my approach to teaching. While projects remain central to my classes, I now incorporate testing as a critical component of the learning process. Testing offers two major benefits: students immediately understand what they know and what they don\'t, and as a teacher or team manager, I gain insights into my performance and where to pivot my efforts to ensure my students are positioned to excel.</span></p><p><span >Today, we are bombarded with artificial intelligence products and services designed to boost productivity and efficiency. While these tools are valuable, they are most effective when there is a strong baseline understanding of your subject matter. It has never been more important to focus on real intelligence—understanding where your team stands and how well you’re performing to ensure that both your team and the clients they educate achieve A-level success.</span></p><h3 class="font-bold"><span ><strong>We Can Train Your Team!</strong></span></h3><p><span >Since our founding in 2015, we have trained packaging teams from small family-run packaging firms to organizations like Colgate, Smurfit Kappa, and BMW.</span></p><p><span >Learn more about our enterprise training solutions by emailing </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="mailto:info@packagingschool.com"><u><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">info@packagingschool.com</span></u></a><span >&nbsp;</span></p>',

It’s amazing how, with just twelve categories, we can place most humans into one of these groups. The specific types can be broadly grouped into those who want to provide structure, those who yearn for paradise, those who connect with others, and those who leave a mark on the world. Even if you haven’t thought about it, you can probably see yourself relating to one or maybe more of these types.</p><p>Psychology states that archetypes help to understand who a person is, but archetypes also work well for corporate brands.

      "<p><strong>Julie:</strong> Well, first off, I know you, and I've known you for a while, but can you tell us a little bit about your role?</p><p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, so I'm Cory Connors. I'm the Director of Sustainable Packaging Solutions at Orora Packaging, and I am also the host of Sustainable Packaging Podcast. My role is fairly unique in the industry. I spend a lot of time working with our customers to help them transition to more sustainable packaging, which is my favorite part. I truly enjoy working with people, getting to the root of their issues and what they're trying to solve—not just, “Hey, can you quote these boxes?” No, let's really talk about how we could organically look at your whole system and how you're using packaging and how we could eliminate some packaging, possibly. I know that sounds counterintuitive from a packaging company, but we want to use the least amount of packaging to successfully do the job.</p><p><strong>Julie:</strong> That kind of leads right into my next question . . . so how do you believe that packaged products should be designed to yield sustainability benefits, either through lightweighting, through improving recycling and recyclability—what are some things that you feel like talking with your clients and your network, how can you do that better?</p><p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, I really see it as a pie, and I think the wedges on that pie continue to change as extended producer responsibility laws come to fruition—things like reusable packaging are going to be more popular and needed to accomplish the goals set forward by municipalities and states and governments—nationally and internationally. So, the answer is all of the above. And, in my opinion, we have to continuously look at—”Okay, we tried this, the LCA worked six months ago, does it still work today?” We're looking at higher post-consumer recycled content for packaging; post-industrial waste is great as well. And then how do we make that packaging so it's easy for the consumer to recycle or reuse?</p><p><strong>Julie:</strong> So at the Packaging School, we love to stay on top of sustainability trends. It's obviously hard work, as you know. So as the sustainability director for your company, what are some driving trends that you're seeing for 2024 and moving forward?</p><p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, unfortunately, there's a lot of fear in the industry right now. People are scared about what's happening with the extended producer responsibility laws coming out. They're very nervous, so they're coming to us and saying, “Hey, how do we work within these new rules and still successfully deliver our products to our customers in packaging that will keep it secure and won't let it rot?” There's nothing sustainable about rotten food, right? So we need to look at all of those issues. But what I'm seeing on a general basis are things like a switch to mono-material, and higher PCR content—we're gonna keep hearing about that even in things like stretch film, which is a first in the industry—very exciting to see that potential. A lot of people are frustrated by pallet wrap or stretch film, but it's a very effective packaging tool. And so, if we can come up with high PCR stretch wrap and then recycle it again, that all of a sudden is a circular economy and very, very positive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Julie:</strong> What are your thoughts on the carbon credit / carbon offset / carbon trading world?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, I think the answer is tread softly there. I think there's a lot of concern about the regulation there. I love the idea if it could work and if it was actually effective, but I don't want it to be a scapegoat to not follow the rules of sustainability—just “Oh, hey, we'll just pay and&nbsp; somebody else will be sustainable.” No, I want it to be a supplement to aggressive action towards a more sustainable, more circular economy—reuse, recycling is so critical, composting where possible—all of these things are gonna work together. If people are just “Oh, I can just buy carbon credit, it's no big deal,” then that's a problem. That mindset, I think, is faulty. So we, as a society, if you are doing all that you can and you still need some carbon credits to kind of get to that net zero number, then that's great. And I appreciate that and am thankful for that as long as those carbon credits go towards funding something that really helps our planet.</p><p><strong>Julie:</strong> Working at Orora, working for your own entity as <em>Cory Connors</em> and your podcast for sustainability, what are some industry-spanning sustainability initiatives you guys are looking at in the future for 2024 and so on?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Connor:</strong> Yeah, I'm really excited about what Orora Packaging is doing. I can't tell you all of our secrets, but I can tell you that we've invested a lot of resources into our sustainable design lab in San Jose, California. And what we're doing is we're inviting our customers to that lab, or potential customers, to look at what they're using and then use those resources that we have all in this one building with our top designers and all the testing equipment and prototyping equipment that you could possibly need to create a new package, so the customer could leave with an actual prototype to be able to show their senior team—it's amazing.</p>",

      '<p>The Code of Federal Regulations states, “a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading.”&nbsp;More specifically, “a container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading if it contains nonfunctional slack-fill.”&nbsp;Slack-fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled to less than its capacity for reasons other than the six categories listed below.</p><p>So, consider an example of strawberry jam . . . the consumer can fully view the contents of a clear packaging jar of jam. There is no need to worry about slack-fill here. Even if the package was taller, but contained the same amount of jam, the package would not be misleading as the reasonable consumer can see the product contained in the package.</p><p>But, let’s consider another example—3oz of ground black pepper in a 4oz tin. Seems fine, right? Actually, no—this is potentially misleading—as the difference becomes apparent when we put the 3oz of pepper in a clear 4oz box. This is non-functional slack-fill and it is why we need to be cautious when designing our packaging.</p><p>There are only six categories that can be defined as “functional”&nbsp;slack-fill. These are:</p><ol><li><p>Protection of the contents of the package;</p></li><li><p>The requirements of the machines used for enclosing the contents in such package;</p></li><li><p>Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling;</p></li><li><p>The need for the package to perform a specific function (e.g., where packaging plays a role in the preparation or consumption of a food), where such function is inherent to the nature of the food and is clearly communicated to consumers;</p></li><li><p>The fact that the product consists of a food packaged in a reusable container where the container is part of the presentation of the food and has value which is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function to hold the food, e.g., a gift product consisting of a food or foods combined with a container that is intended for further use after the food is consumed; or durable commemorative or promotional packages; or</p></li><li><p>The inability to increase the level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package (e.g., where some minimum package size is necessary to accommodate required food labeling (excluding any vignettes or other nonmandatory designs or label information), discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices).</p></li></ol><p>There are cases where non-functional slack-fill is present, yet the brand owners have made good efforts to depict the product on the package. There are also cases of marginal slack-fill where brands may have inadvertently used packaging or print to veil the difference in volume, resulting in a lawsuit.</p><p>There is not a clear methodology of assessing slack-fill. There is also not a published threshold of acceptable amounts of non-functional slack-fill. As a packaging professional, you need to be cautious of non-functional slack-fill—it’s simply not permitted.</p><p>Slack-fill is a growing concern—you can check out our Packaging Regulations course to view additional slack-fill packaging cases at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-laws-and-regulations">https://www.packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-regulations-101</a>.</p>',

      '<p>Clean labeling means different things to different people. To some, a clean label means a product free of chemicals or artificial ingredients. To others, it may mean a product with Non-Gmo ingredients. Whatever the case may be, the trend is products that are better for the consumer and the environment.</p><p>Clean labels do not have a legal definition, but rather, are defined by consumer preference. Today’s consumers are increasingly interested in a shopping experience where they can purchase products without an ingredient list that takes up half the package. Consumers crave natural products devoid of artificial flavors, colors, additives, and ingredients that are Non-GMO. Brands know this and make sure their packaging labels draw those consumers in. For this reason, companies are choosing to label their packages with phrases such as “no artificial preservatives,” “100% natural,” “GMO-free,” and so on. Two words commonly used to promote a clean label are <em>natural</em> and <em>organic</em>. Let’s look at those terms a bit more.</p><p>Natural is a word applied to many packages. This can cause some issues, as it is hard to define exactly what <em>natural</em> means. Companies could argue that all of their ingredients are natural because they all started that way, but processing foods is what complicates the term. When is something processed to the extent that it is no longer natural? Currently, a food product can be labeled natural if it is free of any artificial and synthetic ingredients (including all color additives), as stated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Organic labeling is regulated by the National Organic Program (NOP) which is overseen by the USDA. The regulations can be found in title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 205. If the product has been bioengineered, it cannot fall under the organic certification. There are four basic National Organic Program categories:</p><ul><li><p>100% organic—meaning it contains all organically sourced ingredients</p></li><li><p>Organic—if it is labeled with just the phrase organic, this means the product is made up of at least 95 % organic ingredients</p></li><li><p>Made with organic ingredients—means the product is at least 70% organic</p><ul><li><p>If the product is less than 70%, there cannot be a label on the package, but the ingredients listed can disclose which ingredients are organic</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>So, just what exactly is the difference between the USDA organic seal and a standard organic label? To place the USDA organic label on your product, there are specific requirements which must be met:</p><ul><li><p>The product must be produced without methods such as genetic engineering or ionizing radiation</p></li><li><p>The product must only use the ingredients listed on the national list of allowed and prohibited substances</p></li><li><p>A USDA certifying agent must oversee the process to verify that the product follows all regulations</p></li></ul><p>If a product is 100% organic (following these requirements), it will receive the official seal (shown here). If only 95% of the product is organic, it will have just the organic phrase.</p><p>The clean labeling trend is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Consumers are more concerned than ever about the ingredients not only in their food, but their cosmetics, vitamins, household cleaning products, and more. Labeling your product correctly to fit this growing demand will keep you from being overlooked for the more natural option sitting beside your product on the retail shelf or the eCommerce website. </p>',

      '<p>We’ve all heard how schools and universities across the nation are making the switch to virtual classrooms—some for the rest of the school year. This means students, parents, and working professionals are adjusting to and using technology they may have never used before. Making such a big change in a short period of time can be scary, but it doesn’t have to be. Because our mantra is to always stay positive, we found a few reasons to look on the bright side!</p><p>Donna J. Abernathy said it best: “online learning is not <em>the </em>next big thing . . . it is the <em>now</em> big thing.” Online courses may not come with a traditional classroom setting, and you might take notes on an iPad or tablet instead of using a pencil and paper, but that doesn’t take away from the education you’re getting. Thanks to eLearning, you’re still able to absorb tons of material (from the comfort of your couch!) and apply it to very real industry scenarios.<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>Read this carefully and let it sink in: Learning through a screen does not invalidate the material—instead<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)">,</span><em> it</em><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><em>trains</em><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><em>you</em><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>to sharpen your real-world application skills!<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>A graduate from the<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/certifications/get-to-know-cps">Certificate of Packaging Science</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>program was able to utilize everything he learned through our online platform during his role working at a factory his family owns and operates.

Say goodbye to traffic and hunting down a parking spot and just embrace all of the bonuses that come with virtual classrooms. Forgot the notes you need for the next class? No big deal! A quick walk to the spare bedroom solves that problem. And the convenience of online education doesn\'t end with the reduced traveling—online courses make note-taking much easier as well. Have you ever missed the third key point of the instructor’s five-point list? You spend the next several minutes trying in vain to remember, consequently missing out on even more information. But learning online allows you to simply pause or rewind a video lecture to make sure you absorb everything.</p><p>The opportunity we’ve had to jump into the world of online learning and conducting business remotely will benefit us long after we’ve adjusted to being back in schools or the workplace. So, take the extra time in front of your computer to embrace online learning. This once theoretical now field-tested technology will likely continue to be a part of our routines once the world reopens.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Not sure where to start your online education?

      '<p>Before you even consider zeroing in on your brand, you need to think about trademarking it. And even before that, you need to search what has already been trademarked. Nothing is more deflating than finishing your branding process only to find that your name already exists or some form of your logo has already been created. The first thing you should do is search to see if any form of your preliminary brand is already being used. The website of the United States Patent and Trademark Office has a<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database">trademark database</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>where you will be able to see if the mark you are considering is already in use or applied for, or if there are similar existing trademarks. A google search is also a good idea, as there may be unregistered trademarks similar to yours in use as well.</p><p>So, let’s define the word trademark. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Department says, “A trademark includes any word, name, symbol, or design, or any combination used, or intended to be used in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods.” A trademark indicates the ownership of brands, and protects a packaging or product design from theft or copying.</p><p>There are two broad categories of trademarks recognized in the United States: unregistered and registered. Varying factors determine which of these you should choose for your brand or logo. However, the level of protection you think you will need for your brand ultimately determines the path. If you own a business of any size, you should at least have an unregistered trademark. To gain an unregistered trademark for your brand or logo, begin by adding the trademark symbol (™) to your design. And that’s that. For real. Placing the ™ symbol with your brand on all correspondence, websites, invoices or packing slips constitutes use and is all you are required to do for an unregistered trademark.</p><p>The first move toward protecting your trademark is to actively use it. However, one of the potential downfalls to an unregistered trademark is that it doesn’t offer you much legal protection in case of a dispute. Generally speaking, the company that used the unregistered trademark first will win the case.</p><p>Now, when should you consider obtaining a registered trademark? Here are some reasons you would want to register a trademark:</p><ul><li><p>Your business is growing, prompting the need for more protection</p></li><li><p>You need investors</p></li><li><p>Your niche business may be copied</p></li><li><p>You apply for a business loan</p></li><li><p>You hire an advertising agency for helping promoting your business</p></li><li><p>You are ready to sell your business</p></li></ul><p>You may ask yourself, is registering a trademark a lot more complicated? It has to be, right? There are a few more steps, and to actually have your mark approved can take up to six months.<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/filing-online">The Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS)</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>is a service of the USPTO and is where you will fill out your application to register your mark. Fees range from $225 to $400 per class of goods or services you wish the trademark to be placed on. For example, if you are developing a brand or logo for a company that will place its mark on electronics and food items, you are putting that logo on two different classes of goods and will be charged two application fees. TEAS has a<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/TEAS_Plus.pdf">PDF preview available</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>of the electronic application for you to review before you start the actual electronic application. This is helpful because once you begin the process online, you have a 60-minute time limit to complete your session. You can extend the time limit, but going over the sample PDF should answer a lot of questions before you get started.</p><p>Consideration of these matters at the beginning of a project can protect you from potential issues further along in the design process. Do your due diligence upfront, and it’ll save you a lot of heartache in the long run.</p><p>Learn more about trademarking and packaging regulations in our online course at: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-laws-and-regulations">https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-laws-and-regulations</a></p>',

      '<p><strong>NOT JUST YOUR AVERAGE DAY</strong></p><p>Maybe he awoke with the sun, as was his routine when there was enough light to read his clock. Maybe he then settled into a chair at a nearby table, where he began to tend to his correspondence—something that produced around 20,000 letters over the course of his life.</p><p>A lot was on the mind of Thomas Jefferson that mild July fourth morning.<br>And as he looked out his window upon the Philadelphia landscape pondering what was to be accomplished that day, surely breakfast was next on his to-do list.</p><p><strong>FOOD AND FREEDOM</strong></p><p>Have you ever thought about the food of our forefathers?<br>What they ate, how they ate, and maybe most importantly (from a packaging perspective), how they stored their food so they<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><em>could</em><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>eat.</p><p>For Jefferson, he likely enjoyed a breakfast that consisted of tea, coffee, cornbread, cold ham, and butter. Sounds simple enough, right?</p><p>Although Thomas Jefferson was most certainly in a different class, there was no escaping the fact that he nor anyone else in 1776 had any kind of refrigeration or colonial Tupperware to keep their food fresh (and safe) for consumption.</p><p>In the 18th century, most households spent the vast majority of their time preserving foods for long-term storage—in short . . . to survive another year.</p><p>Canning wasn’t a reality at that time (Nicolas Appert<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>began experimenting in the late 1700s), so foods were stored in various ways using inventive methods.</p><p>Chickens and small game could be consumed year-round since they could be eaten in a meal or two. But when it came to other foods, early packaging and storage methods were employed.</p><p>For the meat of larger animals (cow and pig), butchering was put off until the colder months since warmer temperatures would cause spoilage within a few days. The meat would be salted, smoked, brined, and even potted (cooked meat packed tightly in an earthen jar and sealed with a thick layer of butter, lard, or even rendered beef fat).</p><p>Drying, pickling, and cold storage (in a root cellar or basement) was reserved for eggs, cheeses, fruits, and veggies.</p><p>While this post hasn’t plumbed the depths of colonial food storage and early American fare, doesn’t it make you thankful for the innovations in storage and packaging?

      'Have you ever thought about the food of our forefathers?\nWhat they ate, how they ate, and maybe most importantly (from a packaging perspective), how they stored their food so they could eat.\nFor Jefferson, he likely enjoyed a breakfast that consisted of tea, coffee, cornbread, cold ham, and butter. Sounds simple enough, right?\nAlthough Thomas Jefferson was most certainly in a different class, there was no escaping the fact that he nor anyone else in 1776 had any kind of refrigeration or colonial Tupperware to keep their food fresh (and safe) for consumption.',

      '<p>The <strong>Pygmalion Effect</strong> is a phenomenon in which a person’s performance rises or falls according to the expectations of their leader. This can be seen in the workplace when employers see a team member not reaching their fullest potential. When employers set lofty but reachable goals and encourage employees to strive for them, employees respond to this positive influence. The trust and value imparted from the boss help to boost the confidence of the employee. Because of the level of moral all around, they may even exceed expectations.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a pretty fascinating example of this aspect of human behavior<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><strong>in packaging. </strong>VanMoof, a Dutch bike manufacturer, faced serious problems with costly bike parts being damaged during transit. Their high-end bikes are equipped with fragile electronics like an anti-theft system and pedal-assist technology that weren’t surviving the normal rough and tough handling of the delivery companies.</p><p>For a company that hopes to sell 90% of their bikes online by the end of the decade, this was a huge problem.

      'The Pygmalion Effect is a phenomenon in which a person’s performance rises or falls according to the expectations of their leader. This can be seen in the workplace when employers see a team member not reaching their fullest potential. When employers set lofty but reachable goals and encourage employees to strive for them, employees respond to this positive influence. The trust and value imparted from the boss help to boost the confidence of the employee. Because of the level of moral all around, they may even exceed expectations.',

      "<p><span >One of the most common types of metal containers is the metal can, which comes in two primary styles—two-piece and three-piece cans. So we have a two-piece can and a three-piece can. And so the difference is that a three-piece can, this body right here is a single piece. There's an end at the bottom and an end at the top. That's the three-piece can.</span></p><p><span >But in this lecture we're gonna talk about the two-piece can. The two-piece can is probably what you're familiar with. It's a solid body all the way through. And then just one end, making it two-pieces. There are several processes to manufacture two-piece cans—notably the redrawing and ironing processes. Each have their slight variations, enabling production in mere fractions of a second. So, let's dive into the details.</span></p><p><span >The process begins with a metal sheet, which historically was tin-plate steel, but is now predominantly aluminum. Circles are punched out from that sheet and are then formed into cups. You'll notice that the cup's diameter is much larger than the final can’s diameter. And so, depending on the method of manufacturing, we can draw and redraw, which means pushing this cup into different dyes ultimately resulting in this. But also the ironing process, which forces these shapes into rings and slowly moves the thickness of this metal up taller and taller and taller to, ultimately, get to our final can structure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >But why a dome at the bottom of the can? In order to hold highly pressurized systems, an arc is formed into the bottom—the dome of the can. The dome of the can allows pressure to be distributed across that arc. And while I can deform this can very easily by pushing on it, there's not much I can do to deform that dome at the bottom. It's incredibly strong. Similarly, the internal pressure of carbonated beverages applies tension to the can's walls, reinforcing them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >After sizing, the can is coated inside and out. The exterior receives a brand specific coating and printing. Once that happens, we'll have the final can print. So, this is your end graphics that are printed directly onto the canned, but you'll still see we haven't done anything with the top yet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >And that'll begin the necking process—it tapers the top of each can, enhancing its structural integrity and reducing material use due to the smaller diameter. This process also creates a flange, which is essential for forming the double seam.</span></p><p><span >And then, our final can design here. So, we have the necking that has occurred and the taper, and you can see the flange on the very top. It's ready to be coated on the inside, which is a plastic coating that is ensuring that there will not be a reaction between the metal itself and the products that are being placed into it. And it'll be coated, filled with the product, and then, finally the end will be placed on it—right on top. And in this particular case, the flange and the end will match up, and then, the double seam will be made. And you can see here, the coating on the inside of the end that is used as a gasket. So, when that double seam is made, this coating is applied in there to ensure that none of the gases escape out of the can.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >And interestingly, cans carry a hidden code at the bottom revealing its manufacturing origin and method. So this aspect, among others, underscores the can’s fascinating history and its status as an infinitely recyclable product, produced in an instant.</span></p>",

      '<p>In today’s industry, there is an increasing demand for environmentally friendly packaging and, because of that, there is more pressure on suppliers to improve packaging sustainability.</p><p>Paperboard is a very sustainable material as it is made from trees and can easily be recycled. These trees come from sustainable farms that plant, harvest, and replant the trees that are specifically grown for packaging and other consumables. According to International Paper, about 4 million trees are planted 3–4 times more than what is harvested. Ultimately, these carefully maintained tree farms contribute more trees to create a balanced ecosystem. Wood is a renewable source that has a minimal impact on society, and manufacturers can increase their sustainability by finding ways to minimize water and energy consumption while using this material.</p><p>There are two main organizations that help keep our forests flourishing and sustainable. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) sets the standards for the way a forest should be managed. Standards for certification are high, but their stamp of approval ensures that the materials you receive come from a sustainable source. The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is an international organization that works with the entire supply chain to guarantee that sustainable forestry needs are met.</p><p>Paperboard is highly recyclable since it is made out of organic material. Paper and paperboard have the highest percentage of materials recovered in recycling. Over 75% of all paper-based packaging is recycled, and much of that is recycled directly back into new packaging materials. This makes paperboard a sustainable choice for packaging and helps take a step forward for a greener world for generations to come. It meets the current needs for packaging material, but does not do so at the expense of our social or ecological future.</p><p>To learn more about the sustainability of paperboard check out our Paperboard Cartons course <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/paperboard-cartons">here</a> (you can even do a free trial of it!).</p>',

      '<p>Polymers can get complicated quickly. Thermal properties play a large role in the behavior of polymers, causing them to react in different ways. Let’s look at different properties of polymers in relation to temperature.</p><p>There are three types of polymers: amorphous, crystalline, and semicrystalline. Amorphous polymers contain chains that are not ordered in crystalline structures. The thermal properties of an amorphous structure are referred to as the glass transition temperature, denoted as Tg.</p><p>Glass transition is exhibited by amorphous polymers and amorphous areas of a semicrystalline structure. Crystalline structures do not have a Tg. Crystalline structures have a melting point where the polymer chains lose their crystal structure and become a disordered liquid. This phenomenon is denoted as Tm. Melting is only seen in crystalline structures and not in amorphous polymers or amorphous regions. Almost all crystalline polymers have an amorphous region, making them semi-crystalline.</p><p>Let’s start off with a basic term—kinetic energy. Heat is kinetic energy, defined as the energy of objects in motion. So let’s apply this to polymers. When a polymer is hot, its molecules have a lot of kinetic energy and move around very fast. If the polymer is cold, there is little kinetic energy and the molecules move around very slowly or not at all.</p><p>The temperature of a polymer can greatly affect the way it responds to stress. If the chains are heated and you try to move them, you will find that they are already moving and will change their positions very easily to remove stress placed on them. If the chains are cold and you try to move them, the position can’t easily be changed. In this case the chains are either strong enough to resist the stress, or they will break due to the stress.</p><p>Thermal expansion is the concept of materials taking up more space as the temperature increases. The reason for this is that as the temperature increases, the kinetic energy increases and the atoms vibrate over a longer distance. This is measured as the expansion of volume.</p><p>The thermal expansion can be measured using Thermomechanical Analysis. Thermal expansion is important in packaging to understand the tolerances of polymers. For example, a closure may have a different expansion than the finish of a bottle in a hot fill application, or a foam cushion may contract in a shipper when cold and the product will sit loosely in the container.</p><p>As you can see, understanding the thermal properties of polymers is critical. Knowing how polymers react to temperature changes gives you further insight into how your plastic packaging is formed and the variances you can have.</p><p>To learn more about the thermal properties of polymers enroll in our Polymers in Packaging course at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.packagingschool.com/courses/polymers-in-packaging-101">https://www.packagingschool.com/courses/polymers-in-packaging-101</a></p>',

      '<p>When you see a package on the store shelf, do you see the front or the back of the package first?</p><p>Now, you may be wondering if this is a trick question—of course you see the front of the package first! (Unless someone has put it back in its place improperly.) But the nutritional labeling is not on the front, and that may be the most critical information a consumer needs to be concerned with when buying a food product.</p><p>That information does have to be printed on the package—in fact, mandatory nutritional labeling on food and beverage packaging has a multi-decade history in the United States. Traditionally, nutritional labeling is located on the back or side of food packaging, leaving ample space for branding and other important product information.</p><p>However, in recent years there has been a movement both internationally and domestically to include front-of-package (often referred to as FOP) labeling systems, which would simplify complex nutritional information for the consumer to encourage healthier choices and to align with national health strategies. The FOP labeling system can take many forms; one of the most common to have been used in numerous nations in the EU is Nutri-Score, a traffic light system.</p><p>Join us as we explore the origins of the movement in the US, the current status of voluntary FOP schemes in the EU, and the debate around the efficacy of FOP labeling, like Nutri-Score</p><h1 class="font-bold"><strong>Origins in the US&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.packaging-gateway.com/news/fda-test-front-package-labels/">front-of-package labeling system</a> is used to provide additional nutritional information on the front of food packaging to give consumers more transparency and context around making healthier choices.</p><p>The idea of a mandatory FOP labeling system for food packaging is relatively new in the US, first being introduced in the Biden/Harris administration in September of last year (2022).&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/White-House-National-Strategy-on-Hunger-Nutrition-and-Health-FINAL.pdf"><em>The White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health</em></a> report lays out a 5 pillar strategy in an effort to “make America truly a stronger, healthier nation.” The following are the 5 pillars guiding the White House strategy:</p><ol><li><p>Improving food access and affordability&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Integrating nutrition and health&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Empowering all consumers to make and have access to healthy choices&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Supporting physical activity for all&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Enhancing nutrition and food security research&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>So, which pillar do you think the development of a front-of-package labeling scheme is tied to?&nbsp;</p><p>If you guessed pillar 3: <em>Empowering all consumers to make and have access to healthy choices</em>, you guessed right!&nbsp;</p><p>Pillar 3 contains numerous subsections. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/White-House-National-Strategy-on-Hunger-Nutrition-and-Health-FINAL.pdf">Subsection A</a> states: “Empower consumers with updated and more accessible food labeling.” One of the actions under this section is to, “develop a front-of-package (FOP) labeling system to quickly and easily communicate nutritional information.”</p><p>The report claims this system will work to help consumers, especially those with “low nutrition literacy,” understand which foods are “part of a healthy eating pattern.” In the section, the Administration mentions both “star ratings” and “traffic light” schemes as examples of FOP formats, which makes sense as they have an emphasis on quick and easy solutions.</p><p>The “traffic light” system, in the form of Nutri-Score, has been used voluntarily by numerous nations since 2017, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/10/23/Industry-divided-over-traffic-light-labelling-in-Europe">mixed opinions on its efficacy</a>.&nbsp;</p><h1 class="font-bold"><strong>The State of FOP Labeling in the EU</strong></h1><p>The application of front-of-package labeling systems, like Nutri-Score, was first adopted in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/en/nutri-score">France </a>in 2017 on a voluntary basis. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/en/nutri-score">Nutri-Score </a>is a voluntary FOP labeling system that measures the nutritional balance of foods with a fixed quantity of 100 grams; the system uses nutrients to limit (calories, saturated fats, sugars, and salt) and those to seek (fiber, protein, nuts, fruit, and vegetables). Companies in France who desire to include a Nutri-Score label on their packaging are able to do so for free, registering on the Sante publiqué France site.</p><p>The system was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/01/31/battle-over-food-labels-looms-as-brussels-prepares-to-make-eu-wide-decision#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20explained%20to,%2C%20France%2C%20Germany%20and%20Spain">adopted by numerous EU nations </a>&nbsp;following its implementation in France, including Spain, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1 class="font-bold"><strong>The Nutri-Score Debate in Europe</strong></h1><p>As of August 2023, the use of Nutri-Score and FOP systems in the nations above are on a voluntary basis.

Diet and nutritional health concepts are much more complicated than an algorithm.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Italian resentment towards the system partially stems from national staples like olive oil, hams, and cheeses often scoring “C” and below on the Nutri-Score system. Nations like Romania and Greece agree with the likes of Bellanova and are pushing for a new approach to an FOP system.</p><p>The opponents of Nutri-Score also point out that the system fails to take into account the degree of food processing and additives, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/01/31/battle-over-food-labels-looms-as-brussels-prepares-to-make-eu-wide-decision#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20explained%20to,%2C%20France%2C%20Germany%20and%20Spain">focusing only on the nutritional balance</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, advocates for Nutri-Score claim the system provides a simple, quick way to help consumers determine which foods contribute to a balanced diet.</p><p>Amy Bragagnini (MS, RD, CSO &amp; spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics) states, “The Nutri-Score may be able to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/nutri-score-the-pros-and-cons-of-europes-food-labeling-system#What-nutrition-experts-have-to-say">offer folks a quick way to determine if a product would be a good fit for their family</a>.”</p><p>In a world where consumers are shopping at a rapid pace, Nutri-Score labels can cut through the nutritional jargon and help any and all consumers gauge which food choices are the most balanced, especially when comparing similar food choices.</p><p>Furthermore, researchers from the University of Göttingen reviewed data from a consumer survey with 1000+ German consumers which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.healthline.com/health-news/nutri-score-the-pros-and-cons-of-europes-food-labeling-system#What-nutrition-experts-have-to-say">explored how Nutri-Score labels could reduce the rate at which consumers were misled by food products</a>.</p><p>The study found that with products like instant cappuccino and oat drinks, the lack of FOP labels led to consumer misconception that products were healthier than reality, which was greatly reduced with the presence of a Nutri-Score label.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that despite usage since 2017, the topic of a mandatory front-of-package labeling system is one of continuous debate. Nations like France and Germany feel the system, particularly Nutri-Score, promotes healthy eating and allows nutritional information to be understood by all consumers.</p><p>Nations like Italy and Latvia feel the system is too simple, is misleading, and should be revised and not prescriptive.

      '<p><strong>Dallas, TX </strong>(March 2019) –<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>Today, the International Society of Beverage Technologists (ISBT) and its Beverage Ingredients and R&amp;D Technical Committee announce the launch of a significant <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/collections/isbt-ingredients">new course</a> to provide detailed information on the key ingredients used in beverage manufacturing. This new offering provides beverage developers with the information they need on how ingredients interact; it provides quality managers information they need to ensure quality beverages; and it provides bottlers key information they need about the ingredients used in a bottling plant, such as sweeteners, water, and CO2.&nbsp; This landmark educational effort is simply titled "Beverage Ingredients,” but the content is anything but simple.</p><p>As a global association, ISBT recognized that there was a lack of consistent and scientific information available about common ingredients used in many beverages. All ingredients used in major beverages are regulated by governments, tested by brand owners and suppliers, and are safe for consumption. But if you want to understand the chemistry and challenges of these ingredients, this is the course for you.</p><p>For each ingredient in this course, you will find information on its history, chemistry, applications, quality issues, regulatory status, and much more.</p><p>This course is applicable for multiple aspects of the beverage industry. Product developers will learn the chemistry behind the ingredients and how they interact to produce a final beverage. Ingredient suppliers and their sales personnel will learn the importance and role their ingredient provides, as well as what their customers’ needs and concerns are. Brand-owner quality personnel will learn how the ingredients impact the quality of the final beverage and what they need to control. Those working in a beverage plant will learn how to handle and test the quality of ingredients they purchase directly.</p><p>As a secondary benefit, those taking this course will be better equipped to respond to consumer concerns about ingredients. “<em>Consumers today are concerned about what beverages they put in their bodies, were it comes from and how they are processed. We see misinformation via a variety of digital media channels lacking technical knowledge. Today’s consumer wants to know more about the science of ingredients and how and why they are used</em>,” says Sally Potter, Director of ISBT’s Beverage Institute. This course will aid beverage industry technical personnel in responding to these issues.</p><p>“<em>If you’re new to the industry or a supplier to a beverage company and you are looking for a way to get new people up to speed quickly or your technical sales group knowledgeable about how their products are used, these are the courses you need to use. If you’re looking for a job change and want to improve your resume you can’t miss this opportunity</em>” says Larry Hobbs, Executive Director of ISBT about this course.</p><p>The Packaging School platform allows individuals access to web-based Beverage Institute courses anywhere and anytime, meeting the needs of today’s fast-paced industry and supply-side around-the-clock operations.</p><p>More information can be found at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/collections/isbt-ingredients">https://packagingschool.com/collections/isbt-ingredients</a>.</p><h2 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>About ISBT</strong></h2><p style="text-align: start">ISBT is the premier international technical society for the beverage industry with almost 700 members worldwide.

      '<p>Cushioning is a material or system used to reduce the shock, vibrations, or both that transmit to a packaged product from an outside force. In order to cushion, a material must deflect upon impact. This deflection allows the cushioned object to reduce its velocity to zero over a longer period of time than it would if it were not cushioned. Dunnage type material provides some cushioning on the first impact, but cannot be classified as resilient. Cushioning, on the other hand, is resilient which means the material can deform yet subsequently return to almost the same degree of shock reduction it offered on the previous impact.</p><p>Cushioning acts as a shock absorber to prevent damage to the product. The cushion reduces the acceleration-time pulse, lowering the acceleration and spreading it out over a longer period of time. In order for cushioning to work, it cannot be too hard or too soft. If it is too hard, it will not deflect much, so high levels of acceleration will be transmitted to the product. If it is too soft, however, it will deflect so much that the cushion becomes solid and high acceleration levels will be transmitted to the product.</p><p>Some of the most commonly used cushioning materials include plastic foams made of polyethylene, polypropylene, flexible polyurethane, and copolymers of polyethylene with polystyrene. Many of the systems made from these foams include fabricated foam parts, molded foam parts, molded foam-in-place, shock mounts (elastomer), helical isolators, blow-molded toroids (Corner-Mate™ for interiors and Skid-Mate™ for pallets), Korrvu™ suspension pack, and Cradelair™ pack. All of these materials are resilient and suited for protecting fragile products from repeated impacts against the same surface.</p><p>The primary need for cushioning material is to protect from shock impacts during handling and shipping. Protection ability of cushioning materials is measured by instrumented impacts, which reveal the amount of shock as acceleration (Gs) transmitted through the cushion at a given drop height. Cushion curves are provided by suppliers and are a graphical plot of acceleration levels transmitted by the material under test over a range of loadings. Cushion curves offer a comparison between different materials. Data for the cushion curves is determined by dropping a guided platen of predetermined mass onto a cushion of known thickness and area from a given drop height. An accelerator located on the platen is used to measure the amount of acceleration transmitted as the cushion deflects with the impact.</p><p>Vibration performance of cushioning materials is measured by using vibrational inputs over a range of vibration frequencies that are typical of the transport environment. Instrumented test blocks are placed on the cushioning material to display resonant frequency characteristics that are useful for packaging designers.</p><p>Cushioning systems are an important component of packaging to protect products throughout the distribution system. As always, you must know the conditions your product will endure to determine if a cushioning system is a viable option for your packaging system.</p><p>Check out our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-distribution">Packaging Distribution</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>course to learn more about cushioning systems.</p>',

But we kept getting better at making our lives better and more convenient.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Packaging Evolves</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">While the use of natural items was okay for ancient packaging, we were always looking for a way to improve it.

You have <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/glass-metal-packaging">glass</a>. Glass bottles can be traced back thousands of years, and they worked better than gourds, animal skins, and pottery.

      '<p>When you think back on your high school days, do a string of nostalgic Kodak moments flash through your mind? The infamous senior trip. Pep rallies. Friday night football games. An inspiring teacher that helped set the trajectory for your life (O Captain! my Captain!), prom, or science class. No, wait, even better—microbiology. Yeah, those were the good old days.</p><p>[crickets]</p><p style="text-align: start">What? Really? No one is with me on missing microbiology?</p><p style="text-align: start">Well, for me (a bit of a nerd), microbiology, the study of small living things called microbes or microorganisms invisible to the naked eye, was one of my favorite subjects. Want to know why?</p><p style="text-align: start">For starters, microbes are diverse and ubiquitous—meaning they can be found almost everywhere. In fact, wherever there are sufficient water and nutrients for growth, there will be microbes. They’re found in soil and dust; in water; in both animals and humans, as well as in many foods and beverages.</p><p style="text-align: start">But what really interested me, was their importance to the food and beverage industry. Microbes like yeasts, molds, and bacteria present an invisible challenge to these industries. If left to grow unchecked in food and beverage products, they can be both destructive and dangerous.</p><p style="text-align: start">For example, the effects of ‘bad’ bacteria can be seen in common manifestations such as sour milk, putrid meats, swollen cans, and off-flavor juices. Nothing you want to encounter in something you’re drinking or eating.</p><p style="text-align: start">Now, before you go out and rid the world of all bacteria, microbes, etc., let me tell you about the other side of things. Yes, microbes tend to have a bad reputation, but they also help create some of the most amazing foods known to mankind! Cheese, yogurt, sourdough, pickles, enzymes, preservatives, and probiotics would not exist without microbes. Can you imagine a world without cheese?</p><p style="text-align: start">Another example of ‘good’ microbes is the yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae—used for thousands of years in baking and fermented alcoholic beverages—which gives us bread, wine, and beer. And kefir, an ancient probiotic beverage made from a bacteria and yeast culture called kefiran, is a delicious drink that offers many health benefits due to its microbial content.</p><p style="text-align: start">Come on, doesn’t this incite some curiosity? Don’t you want to know more about this fascinating subject?</p><p style="text-align: start">Even if many years have passed since your high school glory days, it’s not too late to start learning again!

      '<h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Plastic in the Marketplace</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">For the last 50 years or so, plastic has been steadily overtaking glass as the most common substrate for food packaging, and it’s estimated that plastic will surpass glass in beverage packaging by 2020. It’s not hard to see why . . . plastic containers are generally lighter, reducing transportation costs for the manufacturer—and reducing consumer trips to the car to retrieve the groceries. However, there remains a devoted market for glass with products like pickles and olives, beer, wine and spirits, not to mention artisan and boutique products of all kinds.</p><p style="text-align: start">In some of these cases, glass is still simply the most practical choice. In the case of those pickles and olives, for instance. The pickling and curing liquids are very acidic, and during manufacturing the containers may need to be heated to ensure a vacuum seal. Plastic just does not hold up as well to those kind of needs.</p><p style="text-align: start">It’s a similar story for beer. While glass (especially colored glass) provides your beer with protection from photo-oxidation, it also stands up much better than PET to the high-heat pasteurization process used by beer bottlers. In addition, glass’ impermeability and inertness ensure that beer retains its fizz and refreshing taste. You can find both wine and spirits in plastic bottles (or “boxed wine” with an interior plastic bladder), but the glass containers are generally seen as the more premium choice, housing a more premium product.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Not Just for Food</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">Glass is also used for non-food product packaging. It’s a standard in the cosmetic industry, as it offers safe containment with a luxury appearance. It also provides brand protection for the manufacturer; in an industry where knockoffs are rampant, the complexity of a high-end glass container is much more expensive to counterfeit than comparable plastic would be.</p><p style="text-align: start">Pharmaceutical packaging has long held glass as the norm for its impermeability and inert protective qualities. As the only packaging material regarded by the FDA as “GRAS” (or Generally Recognized As Safe), glass is regularly used to contain liquid medications. Glass bottles, ampules and vials do not leach unwanted chemicals into intravenous drugs, although there was a rash of recalls in 2011 due to poorly made glass “de-laminating” and depositing glass particles into medications. In response to this, the US Pharmacopeia Convention (USP) augmented its standards for testing in 2012.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>Why Plastic?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">So, if glass is so awesome, why is plastic taking over the industry? The biggest factors come down to weight, expense, and fragility.</p><p style="text-align: start">We’ll start with the simplest first—glass breaks. It breaks during manufacturing, shipping, and at your house. And when it does, it causes a huge mess and risks the safety of everyone in the area. New lightweighting techniques and surface treatments are increasing the toughness of glass packaging, but a 12-oz PET soda bottle will still feel safer next to the pool than your expensive beer bottle. Maybe not as much fun, but safer.</p><p style="text-align: start">Consider weight. A 500mL glass bottle weighs about 400g, but a comparable 500mL PET bottle weighs about 10g. While that might add up to a little annoyance for the consumer, that 40 to 1 weight ratio is a very big problem for manufacturers and distributors. It means more wear and tear on packaging machinery, less efficient shipping and distribution, and, as a result, higher fuel costs and emission responsibility.</p><p style="text-align: start">Cost is a factor. Glass is more expensive to produce and more expensive to ship than plastic, and all those expenses will need to roll down to the consumer. Meaning, sometimes, that “premium” orange juice in the glass bottle is just . . . juice. You pay for the panache of the packaging.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>What About Sustainability?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">Even the comparison of sustainability is a little muddy. Yes, glass is 100% recyclable, all the time. But, at least in the US, glass recycling efforts are waning due to the increased cost of separating it from other recyclables and shipping that heavy bulk to the few recycling plants in the country. BUT just about every piece of glass packaging out there contains SOME percentage of recycled material. Plastic, on the other hand, is easier to recycle and uses less energy to complete the task. BUT plastic degrades with each run through the lifecycle; plastic packaging is “downcycled” into lower-grade carpet padding or plastic building materials. The plastics industry counts this as a plus—flexibility! The glass industry considers this a negative—glass will always be recycled as new glass.</p><h3 class="font-bold" style="text-align: start"><strong>It’s Up to You</strong></h3><p style="text-align: start">So, there’s no 100% right answer. When making the choice between glass and plastic, you’ll need to assess a lot of factors. They are both great . . . and they both have their drawbacks to consider. Your product, your audience, and your budget will all play a part in the decision.</p><p style="text-align: start">Head over to our<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/glass-metal-packaging">Glass Packaging</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>course to learn more!</p>',

      '<p>Whether we realize it or not, packaging is one of the most ubiquitous commodities in our daily lives. But how much do you really know about the history of the various substrates and applications we’ve come to know so well? Lucky for you, the Packaging School is here to help!</p><p>Following this short lesson, you will be able to understand the origins of several popular forms of packaging, including glass, paper, corrugated fiberboard, metal, and plastic.</p><p>To begin, let’s start with glass, one of the earliest materials ever used for packaging. The first evidence of human-made glass has been dated all the way back to 4000 BC, but for the sake of a packaging discussion, we\'ll start in Mesopotamia in 1500 BC. By using a naturally occurring material known as “natron,” the earliest glass containers were formed by covering a core of sand (an insert that will be placed into the mold) with a layer of molten glass so that it would form to that shape for easy containment. Jumping ahead to the first century BC, we find the invention of glass blowing in Syria—an innovation that allowed for glass to be formed into much more elaborate shapes.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://blog.bottlestore.com/the-remarkable-history-of-the-glass-bottle-infographic/"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://feve.org/about-glass/history/"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>, </sup><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.mindat.org/min-2858.html"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>A few hundred years later in the 2nd century AD, papermaking as we know it today was invented in China. By pouring a mixture of Mulberry tree fibers onto a porous cloth, then pressing and drying them, a sheet of paper could be formed. For use in packaging, paperboard has its roots in 1839, when a jeweler from Boston began to produce rigid boxes for use in his business. Shortly after came the invention of the folding carton, and in 1879, a mass-production method for said folding cartons was developed.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://paperbox.org/the-paperboard-history/"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Cardboard, or more accurately corrugated fiberboard, was also first used around this time. The first corrugated material was actually used as a sweatband lining in the hats of posh Englishmen in the mid 1800s, but by 1871, it was already being used as a packaging material to protect fragile materials like glass. By the end of the decade, a first and second liner were added to the corrugated material, creating the first instance of what we know as single wall corrugated board. In 1894, corrugated sheets were finally slotted and shaped into boxes, and it’s rumored that just a few days later, the first Amazon delivery took place!<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fibrebox.org/history-of-corrugated"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>The idea of using metal alloys for containment has been around for thousands of years, but we’re going to highlight Bohemia around 1200 AD. This is where the process of tin plating was discovered which led to the development of iron can-like containers being coated with tin. It wouldn\'t be until 1764, though, that it was used for packaging as we may think of it now. Tobacconists in London began selling some of their product in metal canisters, but tin wouldn’t be used for food for 50 or so years due to the prevailing opinion that metal was poisonous for food. This changed when Napoleon Bonaparte offered a prize to anyone who could come up with a way to better preserve food for his armies. This led to Nicholas Appert discovering the idea of “canning” food, and before long, the tin can as we know had arrived.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/cdfs-133"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>The newest form of packaging we\'ll discuss today is plastic. Although not the first type of plastic ever discovered, the birth of plastic packaging can be found with cellophane. Invented in 1900 by Swiss chemist Jacques Brandenberger as a material that could repel liquid, cellophane was adopted by Whitman’s Candy Company as a candy wrapper for their famous Whitman’s Sampler in 1912.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/cdfs-133"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.shilohplastics.com.au/history-of-plastic/"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Innovations to cellophane were rapid around this time, as the original material was waterproof, but not moisture-proof—meaning the product would not be penetrated by water, but it would hold water. This was a problem for Clarence Birdseye, who had recently learned of the concept of “flash freezing” from the Inuit people of Canada. Birdseye wanted to utilize this method to revolutionize the frozen food industry in the US, but needed a moisture-proof form of packaging. Birdseye then contacted DuPont to develop a moisture-proof form of cellophane suitable for frozen foods. Chemist William Hale Charch discovered that when a nitrocellulose lacquer was added to cellophane, it became moisture-proof. And so in 1927, this product made its debut on the market.<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.shilohplastics.com.au/history-of-plastic/"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>While these may be the origins of some of the most popular forms of packaging out there, we’ve only just scratched the surface. Within each of these broad categories can be found dozens and dozens of applications with their own unique histories!</p><p>To learn more about all things packaging, be sure to subscribe to the Packaging School on Youtube, and check us out on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://Packagingschool.com">Packagingschool.com</a>.</p>',

While doing this, they keep the client\'s needs and an efficient use of raw materials in mind. </p><p>Packaging focuses on structural design, and in this case, material options and form, package sealing, package graphics, etc.&nbsp; . Package testing is also conducted under various conditions by simulating real shipping and handling scenarios to ensure packaging durability.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://creopack.com/en/articles/what-is-a-packaging-engineer/#:~:text=What%20does%20a%20packaging%20engineer,machinery%20used%20for%20packaging%20operations"><sup>4</sup></a></p><h1 class="font-bold">Procurement</h1><p>The procurement department requires the proper materials and works to find suppliers with the best prices and most reliable service. It is also important to vet factories for labor and environmental compliance in order to ensure your quality standards are met.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://creativeretailpackaging.com/blog/lesson-in-procurement/"><sup>5</sup></a></p><h1 class="font-bold">Production</h1><p>Production is concerned with ensuring a smooth operation on existing machinery. Before finalizing a design, it is best practice to evaluate the equipment that will be producing your packaged product. </p><p>This component of this stakeholder process is also responsible for establishing and executing policies, procedures, and programs that assure products are developed, manufactured, and marketed in compliance with in-house specifications and all applicable legal and regulatory agencies.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.agcareers.com/career-profiles/food-production-supervisor.cfm"><sup>6</sup></a></p><h1 class="font-bold">Sales</h1><p>Based on the production forecast and abilities, sales will push products to customers either directly or through retail / sales outlets.</p><h1 class="font-bold">Marketing</h1><p>Marketing is the center of the traditional consumer packaged goods workflow. It establishes the target market and requests a package that fits the bill in a unique way. A product manager in marketing will be established who is responsible for the lifecycle of the product and manager of the product team, which includes development, packaging, logistics, production lead, advertising, etc.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/resources/articles/product/product-manager-career-path-from-consumer-products-to-technology-companies/#:~:text=After%20purchase%2C%20the%20CPG%20product,expensive%20part%20of%20the%20product"><sup>7</sup></a></p><h1 class="font-bold">Advertising</h1><p>The goal of the advertising committee is to utilize media that will easily be seen by the target market to get the intended message across. This, in turn, promotes the new product and brings about awareness.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/product-advertising"><sup>8</sup></a></p><h1 class="font-bold">End User</h1><p>One of the most important stakeholders is the end-user. A project’s success is ultimately decided by the capacity of the end-user to desire, buy, and consume the final product.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://digitalmarketing.temple.edu/cfeiring/2019/07/30/end-users-the-ultimate-stakeholders/"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>Overall, packaged products span across numerous departments and stakeholders that should all be involved in some capacity in the project right from the start. Each has a vested interest in improving efficiency (and the bottom line!), consumer affinity, and brand awareness.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/issue-01-9-key-stakeholders-who-can-win-better-packaging-molaba/"><sup>10</sup></a></p>',

Jogging.</p><p>Everything has an origin, and that certainly applies to the packaging industry.<br>By the late 1700s, Napoleon Bonaparte was well-versed in battle and in leading throngs of men.

Those methods, however, were not practical for feeding a vast number of men.</p><p>So, to better equip his forces, Napoleon issued a challenge—12,000 francs to anyone who could concoct a better way to preserve food for travel.</p><p>A few years prior to Napoleon’s request, a French chef and confectioner had begun to experiment with ways to preserve different foods.</p><p>His name was <strong>Nicolas Appert</strong>, and he already had some success in preserving soups, vegetables, juices and such. Appert would place the consumables in glass jars, seal them with cork and wax, and then place them in boiling water.</p><p>Continuing to experiment over the next several years with other products (meat, fruit, veggies, and milk), he formally submitted his innovative process to the French government.</p><p>After agreeing to make his techniques public, Nicolas was awarded the 12,000 francs in 1810. While the delicious and portable food did not help Napoleon achieve victory in Russia, Nicolas Appert achieved his title as the <strong>Father of Canning</strong>.</p><p>So next time you swallow a scrumptious gulp of grandma’s canned peaches, you should say, “Thank you, Nicolas!”<br>Just don’t say it out loud.<br>Your grandma might think you’ve lost it.</p><p>Learn more about glass and metal packaging in our online course at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/glass-metal-packaging">https://packagingschool.com/courses/glass-metal-packaging</a>.</p>',

      '<p>The product is what dictates the specifics of your packaging, so it’s what you need to know and understand before you begin your package design. The first and most important design decision involves the packaging material, and you need to know your product first to make the right choice there.</p><h2 class="font-bold"><strong>What is the nature and form of the product?</strong></h2><p>The product form—whether solid, liquid, or gas—is the first and most obvious aspect that influences the choice of material used for the packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>Have you measured your product beyond just weight and dimensions to understand its nature? For instance, dry products need to repel moisture, while liquids require seals to prevent leakage.

A large percentage of EPR legislation includes requirements for identified producers to join a producer responsibility organization (PRO)—often an industry-led nonprofit focused on working collectively to meet targets, collect and allocate fees, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of EPR is nothing new; the system has been explored and trialed since the early 1990s, with the first system launching in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/lessons/the-evolution-of-germanys-packaging-waste-laws"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Germany in 1991</span></a>.

The map below is a high-level overview of the nations with an active EPR system for managing packaging waste and externalities. As indicated by the map, 63 countries (~32% of the world) currently have some form of EPR system in place in relation to packaging life-cycle management—with EPR reaching all continents but Antartica.</p><p>Included in this article are the nations we have identified as having a mandatory Extended Producer for Responsibility system for managing packaging waste and externalities. It is important to note that this is a work in progress as new developments in the EPR space are emerging daily. We are also monitoring the following nations and their developing EPR programs: Argentina, Ghana, Tunisia, Thailand, Malaysia, Israel, and more.

      'The year 2024 has seen monumental regulatory shifts in the global packaging industry–one area in particular relates to that of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).  \n\nExtended Producer Responsibility (EPR) refers to a regulatory approach in which the producers of packaging (and other products) in a defined territory are made responsible for managing the waste and externalities associated with their products—shifting the burden of packaging waste management from consumers and municipalities to the producers themselves. A large percentage of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation includes requirements for identified producers to join a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO)—often an industry led non-profit focused on working collectively to meet targets, collect and allocate fees, and more. \n',

      '<h3 class="font-bold"><strong>What is SB 54?</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>In June of last year, Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 54 (Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act) into California law.</p><p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www2.calrecycle.ca.gov/Docs/Web/122925">SB 54 Overview Fact Sheet</a>: “The legislation shifts the plastic pollution burden from consumers—who currently pay for landfilling and pollution clean up—to the plastics industry.”&nbsp;</p><p>SB 54 is one of the United State’s most robust packaging EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) laws—containing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/packaging/packaging-epr/#:~:text=On%20June%2030%2C%202022%2C%20Governor,use%20plastic%20packaging%20be%20recycled">3 ambitious goals set to be achieved by 2032.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 class="font-bold"><strong>The 3 Goals of SB 54 to achieve by 2032</strong>:&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><p>100% of packaging in California (both imported and exported) in the state must be recyclable&nbsp;or compostable&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>25% of plastic packaging be cut&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>65% of all single-use plastic packaging in the state must be recycled&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>The California law covers “</strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB54"><strong>covered materials</strong></a><strong>” including:</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Single-use plastic packaging that is not refilled or reused&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Plastic single-use food-service ware (trays, plates, bowls, utensils, straws, and wraps)</p></li></ul><p>You might be wondering—what about “unavoidable” single-use plastics that currently have no viable alternative? California lawmakers considered this by claiming products that are exempt from SB 54’s statutes.</p><p>Furthermore, certain small businesses will be exempt from the regulation’s statutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The California law exempts the following products:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p>Medical products / Prescription drugs&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Drugs for animal medicines&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Products regulated as animal drugs, biologics, parasiticides, etc.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Infant formula&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Medical food&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fortified oral nutritional supplements for chronic medical patients&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Packaging used to contain products regulated by Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Plastic packaging for hazardous materials&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Packaging for flammable and hazardous products&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Beverage containers subject to CA Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act</p></li><li><p>Packaging used for long-term storage (if product has lifespan of not less than 5 years)</p></li><li><p>Packaging under the architectural paint recovery program&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>With SB 54, California became the fourth state to enact a packaging EPR law, joining <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.packworld.com/news/business-intelligence/article/22871778/outlook-of-extended-producer-responsibility-legislation#:~:text=As%20of%20January%202023%2C%20packaging,and%20potentially%20adopt%20similar%20legislation.">Maine, Oregon, and Colorado.</a> Earlier this year, Washington nearly became the fifth state to bring a packaging EPR law (WRAP Act) to fruition, but the act did not reach the House floor in time for a key deadline.</p><p>However, many other states this year, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wastedive.com/news/us-recycling-policy-outlook-epr-plastic-chemical-recycling-repair/641494/">Tennessee, Connecticut, and New Jersey, have announced EPR bills in development.</a> The passing and implementation of SB 54 could potentially serve as a catalyst for other states to develop their own packaging EPR laws for producers.</p><h2 class="font-bold"><strong>How Does SB 54 Define “Producers”&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>With the largest economy in the United States enacting a plastic packaging law impacting both imports and exports from the state, you might be wondering, will SB 54 affect my business?&nbsp;</p><p>SB 54 will cover “producers” of both single-use plastic packaging and food-service ware—including the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mwe.com/insights/a-brief-overview-of-californias-sb-54/">brands involved in the manufacturing, advertising, distribution, and sales of such products.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The law covers all plastic packaging products in the “covered materials” that are both produced in the state and imported or sold into the state. This means that if you have vendors in California, they will be penalized if your product does not comply with SB 54—likely leading to the loss of a client.</p><h2 class="font-bold"><strong>The Role of PROs&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The producers who fall under SB 54 will be guided by two collaborative bodies—a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) and CalRecycle. Essentially, the PRO is a producer-run body responsible for creating and implementing SB 54 objectives, and CalRecycle is responsible for overseeing the PRO’s efforts.</p><p>Producers who fall under SB 54 (e.g., a toy company operating in California that has plastic packaging) will be required to join the PRO by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mwe.com/insights/a-brief-overview-of-californias-sb-54/">January 1st, 2024.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Although SB 54 puts the weight on producers and brands, the PRO forces the covered brands to join together to collaborate and create an EPR program that they themselves fund and operate to ensure proper collection and recycling across the Golden state.</p><p>The PRO, with oversight from CalRecycle, will serve as a vessel to advance SB 54 goals like creating a state-wide packaging EPR program, increasing recycling rates, and others. The participating producers in the PRO will pay a fee that will funnel into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/environment_energy_resources/publications/trends/2022-2023/may-june-2023/california-tackles-plastic/">California Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund</a> for statewide initiatives related to create and maintain a circular economy for plastics.</p><p>The fund ($5 billion USD) will be used to invest in projects for low-income and rural communities in the state. SB 54 not only works to increase recycling and reduce waste in the nation\'s largest state, but it also will provide funding to vital projects for the state’s most vulnerable communities.</p><p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/packaging/packaging-epr/#:~:text=On%20June%2030%2C%202022%2C%20Governor,use%20plastic%20packaging%20be%20recycled">CalRecycle SB 54 Fact Sheet</a>—“SB 54 builds a circular packaging economy.” SB 54 will mandate that producers ensure the following:</p><ul><li><p>Their products are created and marketed using recycled content&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Their products are designed to be recycled&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Their products are collected and effectively recycled&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The circular economy network that SB 54 will work to create includes but is not limited to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Retailers&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Online Retailers&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Consumers&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Sorters and Processors / MRFs&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Producers&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2 class="font-bold"><strong>The SB 54 Timeline</strong></h2><p>As you can see, SB 54 has ambitious targets to achieve by 2032, with multiple milestones outlined in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/packaging/packaging-epr/">timeline below</a>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>June 30, 2022</strong>: Governor Newsom signs SB 54&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2023</strong>: CalRecycle to appoint members of Advisory Group&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2024</strong>: Publish list of recyclable compostable categories + Producer PRO deadline</p></li><li><p><strong>2025</strong>: SB 54 Regulations complete&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2026</strong>: Publish recycling rates by Jan. 1, 2026&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2027</strong>: CalRecycle Report SB 54 Regulations to Legislature&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2028</strong>: 30% of plastic packaging recycled&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2030</strong>: 40% of plastic packaging recycled&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>2032</strong>: 3 Goals of SB 54 Achieved&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>65% of plastic packaging recycled</p></li><li><p>25% less plastic packaging</p></li><li><p>100% of packaging is recyclable or compostable&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2 class="font-bold"><strong>How to Prepare for SB 54’s Impact</strong></h2><p>SB 54 is one of the nation’s most comprehensive EPR bills in the United States to date, and with the sheer size of California’s economy and the bill covering imports and exports, many brands will fall under its requirements.</p><p>For example, a toy company based in Montana whose product line primarily consists of un-recyclable plastic toys packaged in a similar plastic material, and relies on vendors in California as a key market, would have to alter its offerings to align with SB 54 requirements or potentially lose relationships with vendors in the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Brands and producers that choose not to comply with SB 54 will face massive civil penalties, including fines up to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB54">$50,000 USD a day per violation</a>.</p><p>Meaning brands who fall under SB 54’s reach must be familiar with the timeline, components, and alternative recyclable materials in order to ensure compliance and reduce fines.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at the Packaging School, we have an array of online courses that can help you and your organization prepare for upcoming packaging laws like SB 54.</p><p>Our catalog expands 30+ online courses, in a micro-learning format, covering an array of topics in the packaging industry—including courses related to sustainable packaging and regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out these courses to prepare your business for SB54:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-laws-and-regulations">Packaging Laws and Regulations - CPS-C10</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/sustainable-packaging">Sustainable Packaging - CPS-C11</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/polymers-in-packaging">Polymers in Packaging - CPS-C06</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/introduction-to-polymers-and-pet">Introduction to Polymers and PET - PTI-P01 </a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/pet-recycling">PET Recycling - PTI-P08</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/bioplastics-for-packaging-with-dr-sandeep-kulkarni">Bioplastics for Packaging - ELEC-E07</a></p></li></ul>',

We are now producing nearly <em>300 million tons of plastic every year</em>, half of which is destined for single use.</p><p>Since the 1950s, the rate of plastic production has grown faster than that of any other material. Plastic packaging, the main cause for the increase, accounted for 52% of discarded plastics in 2015. If the current trend continues, there will be <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/plastics/overview#:~:text=Designing%20out%20plastic%20pollution&amp;text=We%20must%20change%20how%20we,than%20fish%20in%20the%20oceans.">more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050</a>. As a response to public outcry, companies have committed to increase recycling rates, reduce plastic use, and invest in recycling technology. Governments are taking action too—more than 50 countries have pledged to combat marine litter under the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cleanseas.org/">UN’s Clean Seas</a> campaign.</p><p>With ocean preservation as the main theme at the Chicago-hosted<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uspacksummit.com/">American Packaging Summit 2019</a>, industry leaders had the opportunity to exchange ideas around ways the world’s largest companies can help stop plastic from entering our marine environment.</p><p>As outlined in a<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uspacksummit.com/program-day-2/">presentation</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverfrankcampbell/">Oliver Campbell</a>, Director of Worldwide Procurement and Packaging Engineering at Dell, ocean plastic is a looming environmental and human crisis. Every year, eight million tons of plastic enter the ocean. Without action, this rate will grow to over 17 million tons by 2025.</p><p>To stem the tide on ocean plastic, Dell told industry leaders at the<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uspacksummit.com/">American Packaging Summit</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>that its strategy is to leverage its strengths in innovation and supply chain by creating an open, scalable, and commercially viable solution.</p><p>For years, Dell has incorporated <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/lp/dt/sustainable-devices?gacd=9650523-1125-5761040-266691960-0&amp;dgc=ST&amp;SA360CID=71700000110224013&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA84CvBhCaARIsAMkAvkJHsBerYXsabSj0T9wFny5_Rz6Mw4F3Kl8La5YLctyVMNDTBzb5KF8aAkOhEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">bamboo, wheat straw, and mushrooms into its packaging</a> and, since 2015, has been engaged in ocean plastics. In April 2017, the technology giant launched the first ocean-bound plastic packaging on the XPS 13 2-in-1, its premier consumer laptop, and in the same year, committed to a goal of 100 percent sustainable packaging by 2020.</p><p>Other companies have<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>followed suit. In 2018, 11 value-driven brands including The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, Mars, and Évian committed to using 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging by 2025. Nestlé Waters will <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uspacksummit.com/program-day-1/">reimagine the water bottle </a>by designing for source reduction, recycling, and minimal environmental impact. Its current goal is to use 100% PET or renewable materials in their bottles by 2030.</p><p>In the last few years alone, we have seen a crucial amount of long-term commitments to sustainability centering on significant action. But the plastics problem is not an issue that one company can tackle single-handedly; companies must collaborate to end ocean plastics.</p><p>A number of organizations, government agencies, and nonprofits have recently advocated for a more circular economy in which we keep plastic in use for as long as possible and out of the natural environment.</p><p>As Campbell laid out in his presentation at the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uspacksummit.com/"> American Packaging Summit</a>, “Many organizations working together with a systems perspective are needed.” Dell recognized this and, as part of a United Nations commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 14, partnered with non-profit Lonely Whale to launch NextWave Plastics in 2017.</p><p>Bringing together a cross-industry consortium of companies to work together in an open-sourced and transparent fashion, NextWave is a collaborative effort to minimize the amount of plastic entering our oceans by capturing it and turning it into raw material for member companies. The resulting product could become a board game for Bureo, which sells a version of Jenga made from fishing nets, or ink cartridges for HP.</p><p>The collective currently sources ocean-bound plastic from Indonesia, the Philippines, Cameroon, Haiti, Denmark, and Chile, and is aiming to add Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and India to its sourcing locations. Its goal is to divert at least 25,000 metric tons of plastics from the oceans by 2025.</p><p><strong>Another effort is the UK Plastic Pact, which aims to hit four targets by 2025</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>100% of plastics packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable</p></li><li><p>70% of plastics packaging effectively recycled or composted</p></li><li><p>30% average recycled content across all plastic packaging</p></li><li><p>Eliminate problematic or unnecessary single-use packaging through redesign, innovation, or alternative (reuse) delivery model</p></li></ul><p>The program is the first of its kind to tackle the issue of plastic waste through collaboration across the entire supply chain, and it, along with Dell’s NextWave Plastics, reinforces that the plastics issue is not something that one company can tackle alone. Small businesses and key industry players alike must form a global movement to achieve a more sustainable future.</p><p>The hunger for change from the public, the engagement from governments, and the enthusiasm seen in the packaging industry indicate that serious change is possible—and on the horizon—if we continue to work together.</p><p>Interested in what you can do to contribute more toward reducing plastic waste?

      '<p>Ink is a major part of the printing process . . . it’s what creates the intricate designs on packaging and allows us to understand the product and its intended use. Without ink, the packaging world would be a dull place!</p><p>There are three basic components to ink: pigment, vehicle, and additives. First is pigment, which is the solid component to ink. The pigment does not dissolve in the vehicle, but rather is suspended in it. Pigments are where we get the actual color of the ink. The vehicle is next, and it is the liquid component to the ink. Depending on the type of vehicle that is used, it helps determine the stiffness, drying rate, adhesion, gloss, and rub resistance of the ink. It can be a combination of resins that help bind the pigment to the substrate or solvents. Lastly, are any additives that may or may not be needed.</p><p>Let’s look at the coloring agent of the ink—our pigments. There are two broad categories: inorganic and organic pigments. Organic pigments contain carbon atoms which form strong stable chemical bonds and are always present in animal, vegetable, and synthetic organic chemistry. Organic pigments are usually bright, pure, light in weight, and rich in tinting strength.</p><p>Inorganic pigments tend to be dry ground minerals. They contain metals and are often opaque, while most organic pigments are considered transparent. Titanium dioxide, on the left, is one of the most widely used inorganic pigments and is used extensively in packaging applications. Another example is aluminum, which is used to create metallic inks. Bronze is also used as a metallic ink. Inorganic pigments offer great lightfastness or resistance to fade after being exposed to light for an extended period of time.</p><p>Organic pigments are created in labs using carbon chemistry. These pigments are created by combining 2 colorless liquids to precipitate a pigment from the reaction. Once a pigment is precipitated out, the remaining salts are rinsed out with water. This results in a presscake that contains about 60% water. With flexographic inks, the presscake is dispersed into the vehicle, while lithographic inks require the water to be removed by binding the pigment to oil instead and the water is flushed away. The inks created from organic pigments are transparent and their lightfastness varies.</p><p>When it comes to deciding whether to use an organic or inorganic pigment, the following must be determined: (1) if the opaqueness of the pigment is a driving attribute, (2) the vibrancy of color is the key criteria, and (3) if its ability to withstand light and weather is paramount. Organic pigments tend to generate brighter and richer colors than inorganic pigments. However, organic pigments are usually more prone to fading or being destroyed when they are exposed to sunlight and harsh chemicals than are their inorganic counterparts. Many organic pigments, when applied in a single layer, are incapable of generating a surface coat that will completely hide the undercoat, while inorganic pigments are generally more opaque.</p><p>Enroll in the free trial of our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-printing">Package Printing</a> course to learn more!</p>',

First is pigment, which is the solid component to ink. The pigment does not dissolve in the vehicle, but rather is suspended in it. Pigments are where we get the actual color of the ink.",

      '<p>Thermoforming is a process to form plastic material by the use of a mold—it can be done as an inline or offline process. Thermoforming is known for making what we call “blister” packages. Thermoforming can be intermittent or continuous motion. Some of the most common packages that use this method are yogurt cups and the blister packs that contain medication. These packages can also be used to hold other products like electronic devices and toothbrushes. No matter the type of product being packaged, the thermoforming process is similar for all. The primary process involves heating a film to the optimum temperature, forming cavities, loading the product, sealing the backing film, and trimming off the unwanted edges. Usually, the film is supplied off of a roll, but it is possible to receive sheets of the material.</p><p>The process of thermoforming typically begins with a roll of film passing between the upper and lower heaters that soften the film. It is possible to use a heater on only one side, but this can make for an uneven heat distribution and cause problems in the forming process. It is critical to have an even heating distribution in the thermoforming process. If the film has multiple layers, it is imperative to heat both sides of the film. Optimal temperature is imperative because if there is excess heat, the film will become too soft and could even melt. If the film is too soft, it can overstretch, resulting in a film so thin that it is unusable. Once the film has been heated to the optimal temperature, it heads to the forming station. The forming station contains an upper and lower die to form the package to the correct shape. It is most common for the female die to determine the final shape of the film, but it is possible for the male die to have this job.</p><p>The forming process first starts with the film being positioned over the dies and then they are closed. Once closed, compressed air is blown over the top of the film and a vacuum is in place at the bottom to suction the film to the mold. Having a vacuum at the top and bottom is possible. Some packages are large and need more assistance to form to the mold properly. When forming large packages, a plug can be added to the male section to provide even distribution. Depending on how the plug is made, it can also help add extra thickness to areas through selective film distribution. It is common for the dies to be cooled with water, which in turn helps cool the film to set it.</p><p>Once the package is formed and cooled, it is ready to be filled with the desired product and is moved to the filling and loading station. There are many different techniques that can be used to fill the package. Sometimes the product will fall into the cavity with ease, for example, pharmaceutical pill capsules. In this case, the product can be flood filled. Flood filling uses a feeder to place a hopper of product on the film; brushes can be used to help guide the product into the cavities. It is important to think about the product and the best approach for filling. Liquids are going to need liquid filling systems, while other products may be manually loaded.</p><p>Once the product has been placed in the package, it needs to be sealed before it can be sent to the distribution line. These packages are commonly sealed with foil, plastic, or a paper backing film. The sealing film is placed over the package and enters a sealing station. Sealing is always dependent on time, temperature, and pressure. Sometimes a tab is desired to allow the package to be peeled back for easy opening. This is done by relieving part of the platen.</p><p>At this point, the package has been formed, filled and sealed and all that is left is removing the excess material. To do this, the package moves to a cutting station where knives or slitters are used to remove the unwanted material. There is little waste with thermoformed packages since it is just the edges that are removed. The excess is normally wound on reels and guided to waste bins. Sometimes the packages are diecut to allow a rounded edge—the excess material is removed from the machine by winding it into a take-up reel. This is not ideal as the waste is bulky, but it can be fed into a chipper that chops the material into a waste bin.</p><p>If you need to form plastic into a three-dimensional package, thermoforming is one of the least expensive methods. And while it has a few drawbacks, they pale in comparison to the advantages of using thermoforming for blister package production.</p><p>Take the<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://learn.packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-machinery">free trial</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>of our Packaging Machinery course to learn more about thermoforming!</p>',

      "<p><span ><strong>Nick Riedl</strong>: We talk a lot about how to make packaging more sustainable. But an aspect that many people might not consider are the dyes and pigments that are used to create color. As with any step in the packaging process, this too can be improved upon from a sustainability standpoint. And the team at Nature Coatings are among the leaders in developing innovations in this area. We sat down with Jane Palmer, founder and CEO of Nature Coatings, to learn more about the ways in which sustainable dyes and pigments can help the packaging industry and how they've been able to transform common wood waste into a better performing black pigment.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Jane Palmer</strong>: So, before this business, I had a dye house in Los Angeles, and we were dyeing apparel for brands. And very long story short, we were using existing plant- and insect-based dyes that had been around for thousands of years—you know, found in King Tut's tomb, the Mayans were using them, you know, very romantic, beautiful stories, but very poor performing, very expensive, use a lot of water. And I saw that there was a demand for something like this in the marketplace, but this was not the correct product or type of dye or pigment to really scale and make an impact. So, I had a, you know, crazy idea that I could essentially invent a modern day bio-based pigment that would be high performing and cost competitive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >You know, there's often a lot of industry in lower income parts of the world, including the US, and that industry is often polluting and it causes all kinds of problems for the environment and the health of the community—of people living and working there. And I just feel so strongly that we don't need to compromise our health or our environment to have the color black, like that just makes absolutely no sense to me. And so it was really important to me to create something that is healthier for people who are actually using and making this pigment. You know, it doesn't contain any carcinogens. It's . . . I just feel that everybody should have access to that type of healthy product and chemical and manufacturing. And that's through the entire supply chain. So, it begins with the people who are making the products and then applying the products and then, you know, the consumers who are touching them with their hands every day, and then, also end of life.</span></p><p><span >So, to me, it was super important to make something that was cost competitive because of course, that's where the barriers are. And we've done that. So, we've made something that can be adopted in a, you know, in a lower priced item all the way through having the performance to also work in luxury essentially.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >We have developed a new product line under the title BioBlack, and it's a new black pigment made from wood waste. So, it's an alternative black pigment, and it's all coming from FSC certified wood waste, which is super important because that means it's fully traceable. We know the exact forest it's coming from—it's actually within about 60 miles of our manufacturing plant in the southeast. And the wood goes to a lumber or paper mill, their waste goes to a low value chipboard maker, you know, something like that. And then their waste is usually burned and landfilled. And we step in before it's burned, and we're able to use that as our feedstock for our pigment.</span></p><p><span >And so, we've developed a proprietary process to transform that wood waste into a black pigment. The entire process is carbon negative, so that's a huge selling point for us. And the pigment itself does not contain any carcinogens like PHs, benzene, that are found on many petroleum-based black pigments. It's also, the pigment itself is very high performing. We've passed automotive testing, for example, so it doesn't fade or change color in the sun. And it's price competitive.</span></p><p><span >And as I was mentioning before, my background is in textiles, so that's where we started. And we've been adopted by many big brands—Levi's is one of our biggest customers, which is very exciting. But we're also discovering now and over the last couple years that our pigment is suitable for almost any application where black pigment is being used in specialty ink applications. So, we've been working with companies that create inks for packaging, both for paper and film and cans and bottles, actually too, in the US, which is great. And looking, we're getting into paint and, you know, bioplastics and other areas too.</span></p><p><span >Well, I think it's a super exciting time to be involved in sustainability because people, including corporations are starting to take it more seriously. I think that it's important to look at products holistically. So, as you mentioned before, we're providing the pigment, and that's, that's only one part. And I think in order to make a really big impact, we encourage our customers and suppliers to look at the entire packaging solution. So, you know, what can they put together from the ink side to the raw materials side to even the manufacturing side and incorporating things that use less energy or less water or can promote better recycling at end of life, you know—how can that all be combined to make the most impact? And I think that's really critical because there's not only one silver bullet solution out there that's gonna solve all of our problems.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >So, it's really a challenge for corporations and industries to see how they can tie it all together. But the thing I think is exciting is that there's so much technology out there that it is possible now, where before maybe that wasn't—where you can make, you know, really a total complete package. It's going to be iterative. I think that's the biggest lesson—is that we're not going to see an entire shift in the marketplace overnight. It's going to be iterative. But what we're finding is that our customers are willing to start to incorporate our pigment in all projects moving forward. Maybe they can't retrofit or replace black pigments in legacy formulations, but moving forward they'll use ours.</span></p><p><span >And so there's gonna be this bridge of time that it, you know, it just, it's just gonna take, that's just reality. And then I think it's also just about performance and price basically. So, as I'm sure you know, everything comes down to, well, what does it cost and how does it perform? So, we worked really hard to make sure that we're, we're actually better performing than a lot of black pigments out there. And we look, it looks nicer, it has a blue undertone, not a brown undertone. It doesn't change color. You know, it has all these nice features. And then we're also in the right ballpark for pricing. So, I think that's also something that moves a needle.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Nick</strong>: We'd like to thank Jane Palmer and Nature Coatings for taking the time to share some of their expertise with us.

      '<p>Glad you asked! Once a corrugated sheet is taken off of the corrugator, it is ready to be converted into a finished corrugated product. At the end of corrugator, a slitter-scorer trims the corrugated board and cuts it into large sheets called <em>box blanks</em>. The sheets have been slit to the width of the blank, which will be the height of the box, scored across the flutes (along the Machine Direction), and cut to the approximate length of the blank.</p><p>In order to make a blank that will fold to form a box, it is necessary to score and slot it. Scoring is defined as the creases that cross the flutes and is generally done at the end of the corrugator. Slotting removes the narrow slice of board from between the flaps and is necessary to permit the flaps to fold. Box blanks are produced by the slitter-scorer and slid into an automatic stacker that loads them onto a large, rolling platform. From here, they will be transported to the other machines that will convert them into finished containers. Production workers then use a computer terminal and printer to prepare a job ticket for each stack of box blanks produced by the corrugator. With the job ticket, workers can route the stack to the proper converting machinery. There are three types of converting machines: printer slotters, flexo folder-gluers, and diecutters.</p><p>A <strong>printer-slotter</strong> only scores and cuts in straight lines, making it the most simple of the converting machinery. The printer-slotter is so named because it can print graphics onto the board before slotting it.</p><p>The<strong> flexo folder-gluer</strong> is named for its ability to fold and glue a box blank to form a completed box. The flexo folder-gluer produces only one box per sheet. From the flexo folder-gluer, the finished boxes are automatically stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped in bundles for shipping.</p><p><strong>Diecutters </strong>are used to make unique designs or unusual cuts, slots, scores, vents, hand holes and perforations. There are two main types of diecutters, <em>rotary</em> and <em>platen</em>.</p><p><strong>Rotary diecutters</strong> use continuous motion, feeding the sheets between two cylinders: one with the specific die pattern that produces the desired cuts, and the other that acts as an anvil. Platen diecutters make cuts using an up-and-down motion. Unlike the flexo folder gluer, diecutters leave the box unglued and flat.</p><p><strong>Diecut boxes</strong>, such as pizza boxes, are typically formed by hand or wrapped around a product and joined on a customer’s equipment. Unlike the flexo folder-gluer, the diecutter has the ability to produce multiple boxes per sheet.</p><p>Knowing what you desire as the end goal for your package will guide you as far as deciding what companies to choose to provide the materials needed. Research is required to determine what will be the most cost efficient route to obtain the correct corrugated product. Most often, it is cheaper to go with the integrated companies where they have the ability to control prices to a greater extent than the smaller suppliers. But, depending on time constraints and geographical locations, you may find suppliers that can cater to your specific needs with a piece-by-piece solution.</p><p>Do your research, ask lots of questions and make sure you understand what will be presented to you at the end of an order.</p><p>To learn more, check out our 100% online<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/corrugated-containers">Corrugated Containers</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>course.</p>',

PFAS are compounds that are used to create fluoropolymer coatings with industrial applications like heat, oil, stain, grease, and water resistance. PFAS have been widely used in industry and consumer applications since the early 1940s.&nbsp;</p><p>In the packaging world, PFAS are often used in paper food packaging due to their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/process-contaminants-food/authorized-uses-pfas-food-contact-applications">grease-proofing properties and ability to prevent oil and grease leakage.</a>&nbsp;For example, PFAS are often present in microwave popcorn bags, helping protect the paper-based packaging from grease, oil, heat, and other elements. Similar to other synthetic polymers, PFAS do not break down naturally in the environment, finding their way into our soil, drinking water, wildlife, and more. Due to their durability and barrier properties, the group of chemicals (1000+) are widespread throughout our products and industries, yet many states are starting to question the safety behind these “forever chemicals.”</p><p>Despite their critical role in preserving food packaging and non-stick cookware, organizations like the EPA and CDC have conducted extensive research on the potential negative health effects related to PFAS exposure.

On December 31, 2022, New York’s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/124367.html">PFAS in Food Packaging Law</a>&nbsp;took effect, prohibiting the use of intentionally added PFAS in food packaging systems. The law covers all food packaging under the definition of “packages or packaging components that are intended for direct food contact and are comprised mainly of paper, paperboard, or other materials originally&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/124367.html">derived from plant fibers</a>.” The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation states the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas">EPA</a>&nbsp;studies as one of the primary motivations for the law.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">California</h3><p>Although New York was the first state to have a PFAS food packaging law in effect, California signed one into law October 5, 2021 with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dtsc.ca.gov/scp/food-packaging-containing-pfass/">Assembly Bill (AB) 1200</a>. The law that took effect January 1 of this year is a response to concerns around “plant fiber-based food packaging containing PFAS.”&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dtsc.ca.gov/scp/food-packaging-containing-pfass/">AB 1200</a>&nbsp;bans “all plant fiber-based food packaging containing PFAS that are either intentionally added or present at levels exceeding 100 parts per million total organic fluorine.” California regulators recognized the potential of PFAS to negatively impact human health all throughout their life cycle—from the manufacturing of PFAS to end-of-life.</p><h3 class="font-bold">Washington</h3><p>The state of Washington authorized numerous bans on food packaging with intentional PFAS use, taking effect in February of this year. The February bans included plates, pizza boxes, and plastic wraps. The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ecology.wa.gov/Waste-Toxics/Reducing-toxic-chemicals/Addressing-priority-toxic-chemicals/PFAS/Food-packaging">State of Washington Department of Ecology&nbsp;</a>law also includes bans on bags, bowls, open-top containers, and more that will take place in May of 2024. Similar to the laws in California and New York, Washington’s law focuses on paper and plant-fiber packaging solutions as they are commonly treated with PFAS.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Vermont</h3><p>The state of Vermont also passed PFAS laws in a wider bill covering&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/18/033A/01672">Chemicals of Concern in Food Packaging</a>. Section (a) of 1672:&nbsp;<em>Food Packaging&nbsp;</em>prohibits the sale and use of food packaging with intentionally added PFAS. The law covers manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors and went into effect July 1st of this year.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-bold">Laws Not in Effect&nbsp;</h2><h3 class="font-bold">Connecticut&nbsp;</h3><p>Governor Lamont of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2021/07-2021/Governor-Lamont-Signs-Legislation-Banning-Use-Of-PFAS">Connecticut</a>&nbsp;signed&nbsp;<em>Public Act 21-191</em>&nbsp;into Connecticut law in July 2021. The law is focused on banning the use of PFAS in firefighting foam and food packaging. The ban on firefighting foam became effective in October of 2021 and the ban on PFAS in food packaging is set to come into effect December 31 of this year.&nbsp;<em>Public Act 21-191</em>&nbsp;is part of the Connecticut Governor’s wider 2019 PFAS Action Plan, working to minimize the risk of human health effects on Connecticut citizens caused by PFAS.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Colorado</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1345">Colorado</a>&nbsp;General Assembly has an act in place titled, “Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals Consumer Protection Act,” which is set to come into effect January 1 of 2024. The law goes further than just food packaging, banning the sale of carpets, oil and gas products, and more that contain intentionally added PFAS. HB22-1345 also contains labeling requirements for cookware that require PFAS as a non-sticking agent.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Maryland&nbsp;</h3><p>Passed last July by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0275?ys=2022rs">Maryland</a>&nbsp;General Assembly, the George “Walter” Taylor Act (PFAS Chemicals—Prohibitions and Requirements) works to prohibit the use, manufacturing, and sale of PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam, textiles, and direct contact food packaging. The PFAS ban will take place January 1, 2024 and, similar to other laws, has a focus on paper- and fiber-based food packaging.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Minnesota&nbsp;</h3><p>Another PFAS law coming into effect January 1, 2024 is from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.075">Minnesota&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and their 2022 statutes on Trade Regulations and Consumer Protection. The ban is on knowingly selling or distributing a food package that contains intentionally added PFAS.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.075">The Minnesota Legislature</a>&nbsp;defines “intentionally added” as “PFAS deliberately added during the manufacture of a product where the continued presence of PFAS is desired in the final package or packaging component to perform a specific function.”</p><h3 class="font-bold">Rhode Island&nbsp;</h3><p>Similar to Minnesota’s bill and timeline,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/15/ril.pressrelease.inputform/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;ID=372954">Rhode Island</a>&nbsp;is set to prohibit PFAS from food packaging made or sold in the state starting January 1, 2024. One of the sponsors of the bill, Representative Cortvriend, stated: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/15/ril.pressrelease.inputform/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;ID=372954">There\'s growing concern amongst scientists about the effects of PFAS</a>, enough so that the risks outweigh the benefits of having a grease-free paper wrapper on a cheeseburger.” The bill\'s focus on food packaging is due to the fact that consumers are exposed mainly from consuming food and water contaminated with PFAS.</p><h3 class="font-bold">Hawaii&nbsp;</h3><p>The state of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/sessions/session2022/bills/HB1644_CD1_.HTM">Hawaii</a>&nbsp;has a PFAS food packaging ban that is set to go live December 31, 2024. The law prohibits the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of food packaging that has had PFAS intentionally introduced. The bill explains that alternatives exist for packaging like plates, pizza boxes, and more. Similar to other bills, the Hawaii state legislature also banned PFAS in firefighting foam, a common source of PFAS exposure.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Oregon&nbsp;</h3><p>The next PFAS packaging regulation on the horizon is based in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/healthyenvironments/healthyneighborhoods/toxicsubstances/pages/pfas.aspx">Oregon</a>, set to take effect January 1, 2025. The bill,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.packaginglaw.com/news/oregon-bill-banning-pfas-food-containers-becomes-law">SB 543</a>, was signed in May of this year by Governor Kotek. The Oregon law focuses on prohibiting PFAS use in foodware containers. The Oregon state legislature defines “foodware container” as bowls, cups, lids, clamshells, and other takeout packaging for prepared foods. Unlike other bills, Oregon’s does not mention a particular focus on paper- and fiber-based packaging, instead focusing on food containers as a whole.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">Maine&nbsp;</h3><p>The state of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/32/title32sec1733.html">Maine</a>&nbsp;is set to ban products and packaging sold or distributed in Maine that are created with intentionally added PFAS. The law is to take effect January 1, 2030—a far longer timeline than many other states above. The Maine law also contains an exemption for manufacturers that have less than $1,000,000 USD in total annual sales nationally, meaning the bill will not fully phase out PFAS in food packaging in the state.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold">How to Prepare for PFAS Regulations&nbsp;</h3><p>As highlighted above, 12 US states have already developed regulations to ban PFAS in food packaging and other industries, with 4 of the 12 states operating under live laws. If you are in the business of paper- and fiber-based food packaging solutions, it is essential to be aware of current and emerging regulations around PFAS and other banned chemicals. With 12 states already acting on research that is not fully developed, it is possible that a nationwide ban could occur as new research regarding PFAS and human health is released.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at the Packaging School, we have an array of online courses that can help you and your organization prepare for upcoming packaging laws.

      "<p>Anna: Most beverage cans are going to be made of a two-piece construction. So, this is the one piece, and this is the second piece.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin: So this two-piece like this, the, I don't know what you call this section and the bottom, like, that's just punched and that is the one piece?&nbsp;</p><p>Anna: Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin: Okay. And the second piece is the cap or the top.&nbsp;</p><p>Anna: Yeah, so, that's the typical overall construction of a two-piece can, and they're usually made of aluminum.</p><p>Kevin: Or aluminum?</p><p>Anna: Yes, depending on how you want to pronounce it. They are useful in containing mostly carbonated beverages because the carbonation expands inside the container and that gives strength and stability to the otherwise flimsy material.</p><p>This is steel and these two are also steel. Steel is a stronger material, and it is used for heat processed foods typically.</p><p>Kevin: That was gonna be my question—what would cause someone to say aluminum over steel or steel over aluminum?&nbsp;</p><p>Anna: Yeah, like I said, aluminum is sort of flimsy. So, with heat processing, that usually creates some sort of vacuum or changes the air pressure. So, that's why if you look below this hot melt adhesive . . . actually, this is cold . . . nevermind.</p><p>Kevin: I'm glad you're here because I have no idea—cold melt, hot melt, patty melt . . .&nbsp;</p><p>Anna: I thought this would be hot melt, but it's actually got a cold type of adhesive here.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin: So do you go into the grocery store and do this?</p><p>Anna: I can neither deny nor . . .&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin: Okay! So, you've been escorted out of a few grocery stores before then. Anna, we don't do that here.</p><p>Anna: But the steel, these ribbings here are not just to look pretty. They're actually there so that it allows it to expand and contract with the change in air pressure when the vacuum is created. And most steel cans are going to be a three-piece construction. So, you can see the seam here. This was one sheet, and then it was made into a tube and the top and bottom were added.</p><p>Anna: Another point. So this is from Mexico, made in Mexico, but you can sort of tell that it was made for the United States because this here is required by law in the United States.</p><p>Kevin: So, if you want to market or peddle your goods in the US, you have to comply with US regulations. So, some of these different regions in the world, if they're wanting to enter into the beverage game in the US, they have to put that information on the cans.&nbsp;</p><p>Anna: Yeah. Kevin: Okay.&nbsp;</p><p>Anna: And you'll see that in different ways. Something I've noticed in lots of European packages, probably because there are so many languages packed together in that continent, they have lots of different languages, like tons of different languages [printed on the package].</p><p>Kevin: And that makes sense. I mean, if there's anything that is global and everyone has experience with, it is packaging. I mean packaging is . . . it's everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Anna, thank you for giving us the sweeping . . . and this is a very broad overview. I'm sure we could have talked for another hour about all of these different regions and the different types of cans represented here. But, for now, we hope that you all enjoyed this overview of some of the cans in different regions, how they're made, what they’re made of, and even learning a little bit about Anna's obsession. And if you see her in a grocery store, you might want to just give a little space so that you don't get pulled into her obsession and walked out of the grocery store by a manager. Not that that's ever happened. It hasn't happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, check out more at packagingschool.com. There's lots that you can learn there. We've got courses for not only cans, but plastic, glass, a little bit of everything. We'll see you next time.</p>",

      "<p><span ><strong>Julie: </strong>Hey Mitch, welcome to this interview—so great to have you here!</span></p><p><span ><strong>Mitch:</strong> Thank you so much for having me. Thanks for the opportunity to be able to talk a little bit about my story, my role here, and my thoughts on some of these sustainable packaging trends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span ><strong>Julie: </strong>Awesome. Well, let's dive right in. So first off, tell me a little bit about your role as the business strategist here at the Packaging School.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span ><strong>Mitch: </strong>Sure, the term <em>business strategist</em>, I like to think of it as mainly the omnichannel marketing lead, but also focusing on some other areas like market research, particularly international markets, also looking at content management and strategy for our array of marketing channels, and also using the expertise I got in my master's program to help aid in the development and some of the go-to-market strategies for some of our sustainability related offerings.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Julie:</strong> I know you have a Master's of Science in Sustainability Management from American University. Can you tell us some of your main takeaways from this program?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span ><strong>Mitch: </strong>I'd like to think of it as similar to a traditional MBA where you look at the different functional areas of business, but also looking at everything through the lens of environmental and social sustainability. I would like to say sustainability is not a one-time conversation organization. It must be approached from the start and continuously monitored and revisited with processes involving all stakeholders in this process.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >And you want to view sustainability as a two-sided coin. One is the risk management side in avoiding legal risks, reputational risks. But a lot of times we don't think about the other side of the coin which is the upside, the differentiation, developing that competitive advantage, increasing efficiencies, and reducing costs across your organization. So, viewing it in a number of ways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >Another key takeaway is—everything starts with materiality. And a lot of times this is approached through starting with the materiality assessment when you're</span></p><p><span >launching your sustainability journey. This can be done in-house with engaging all the stakeholders, the relevant stakeholders in your organization. It can also be done through engagement with a third party, which a lot of companies do, but a lot of times they'll do it in-house and sometimes consult these overarching frameworks—one from the Global Reporting Initiative, also known as GRI. They have a materiality assessment framework, which a lot of companies use just to get the wheels spinning.</span></p><p><span >One more key takeaway—there's so many I could go on about—would be that it's an evershifting landscape. It was really cool to get a master's in a nascent industry. Sustainability management is still relatively new compared to other professions. And the shifting landscape was ever so present in my reporting class as new frameworks would pop up week on week. We got to learn about ones that were established, like SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and TCFD (The Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), but emerging ones like CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and TNFD (The Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures) just constantly made the landscape ever so confusing. Companies need to find a way to find out what audience they want to speak to and looking at everything through this lens of materiality to gauge where time and resources should be spent.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Julie:</strong> What do you feel are the most pressing challenges in sustainability today—sustainable packaging today?</span></p><p><span ><strong>Mitch:</strong> Yeah, it's a great question. I could talk for a long time about some of the challenges I see in sustainability management and corporate sustainability as a whole. I'll focus on some of the ones identified in packaging for this convo.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >One of the main things I see is cutting through the jargon or some of the preconceived notions folks have about one material over the other when it's not soundly based in research or in LCA. A lot of times folks are painting one material as more sustainable than the other, but not doing the due diligence to actually compare the systems. And we need to think larger about these issues—if a material might be seen as more sustainable by the public, but it improves shelf life or it's lighter and improves the ability to ship more materials in one load—there's just multiple ways to think about it. We should try to approach it by being material agnostic and then let the data drive us.</span></p><p><span >Another challenge I see in sustainability in packaging is avoiding this concept of carbon tunnel vision. For those who don't know, it is when a lot of folks approach the concept of sustainability, they have this myopic focus on carbon CO</span><span>2</span><span > emissions reductions, which is a big part of the puzzle and something that we need to be reducing. But, it's just a tiny piece of the sustainability puzzle. You have to think of—just think of a packaging system's impact on the environment. It goes far beyond carbon intensity. It can have impacts on water quality, water intensity, eutrophication, biodiversity loss, end of life and pollution to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. So, just focusing only on carbon, again, can hurt you in that risk management side where you say, “Oh, we're not focusing on some other key topics.” But also, it misses a chance to innovate and differentiate your brand by creating cool innovations in the areas of like water intensity or something. So just focusing on carbon is something a lot of the industry does, and it makes sense because carbon and GHG gas issues have been around for a little longer and people have been talking about them and there's more frameworks to measure them. And it's a big topic of conversation. But as I said, it's a tiny piece of the sustainability puzzle. And I think people are overlooking that sometimes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span ><strong>Julie:</strong> You've done a great job at the packaging school to incorporate the UN Sustainability Development Goals or SDGs into our curriculum. So basically, how do you think companies in the packaging industry can use these goals to shape and steer and communicate to be able to report these strategies and goals and activities in their everyday workforce?</span></p><p><span ><strong>Mitch:</strong> I see the SDGs as a launching pad for your sustainability journey, similar to materiality assessment. If you're new to thinking about sustainability and you want to think about, “Where does our organization, where do we have an impact on these lofty world goals?”—if you're not familiar with the SDGs, it's 17 goals set forth by the UN that are targets in mind for 2030 and they're more for industries at large for private and public sectors—so if you want to think about, “Where does our organization have an impact?” that's usually a good place to start. I also would recommend diving in further to each of the SDGs because they might seem lofty. SDG 12 is Responsible Consumption and Production, and you might be thinking, “What does that mean?” But if you dive into the targets and indicators, they'll have many under each. So 12.2 is one in SDG 12. A lot of times companies will say they align with SDG 12, but further in a report, will align with a particular sub-target that's a little more time bound and specific than just the overarching SDG. So if you haven't explored that with the SDGs, I highly recommend it. You can look at it through the website and then, each SDG, you'll click on it, and it has targets and indicators.</span></p><p><span ><strong>Julie:</strong> How do you feel that education can help spur this meaningful change?</span></p><p><span ><strong>Mitch:</strong> Absolutely. Education, I think, is one of the critical keys in this process, and this is one of the reasons I love my role here and love working here, is that we're making a tangible impact and we're helping create internal changemakers in organizations and pushing the industry forward through our training and programs.</span></p><p><span >Education is huge. Our online format makes it easy for ways in which we can engage people who are already in companies and might have great packaging knowledge or packaging engineering knowledge, but giving them that sustainability thought can help push their organization forward. So for me, I see education as one of the key components moving it forward, which makes the work we do here so exciting in my view.</span></p>",

      '<p>Every single day, we are exposed to innumerable amounts of audio and visual input. Really, that input possesses no meaning whatsoever. It’s how our brain processes the data that gives the input any sort of meaning or context. Some savvy creatives (or depending on your viewpoint—scheming creatives) understand this, and have been known to apply that knowledge to many forms of media over the years.</p><p>As consumers, we all have been subjected to hidden messaging. Those communications have been in the form of subliminal messages and supraliminal messages. Before we take a deep dive into those types of messages, there is one critical concept that must be understood—the concept of absolute threshold. Absolute threshold is the degree of intensity required of a stimulus to be detectable by the human senses 50% of the time.</p><p>Here’s an example: Imagine you enter a very dark room from a well lit room. It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust. As your eyes are adjusting to the darkness, you notice a lit candle. The moment you are able to <em>perceive</em> the lit candle is the absolute threshold. The absolute threshold is the smallest amount of light that you can detect.</p><p>Most people are familiar with subliminal messages. Subliminal messages are defined as signals <em>below</em> the absolute threshold level of our conscious awareness. That means that you cannot become consciously aware of a subliminal message, no matter how hard you try to detect it. So, while you may have heard many stories about subliminal messages in advertising, these may not have been instances of subliminal messaging at all since you cannot <em>consciously</em> perceive a subliminal message.</p><p>When it comes to hidden messages in ads, it’s more likely what people have experienced are supraliminal messages. These are signals that we are able to detect consciously (although, we fail to notice them most times) because they are perceived <em>above</em> the absolute threshold. Usually, when you hear stories or read posts about “Subliminal Advertising,” they are usually supraliminal tactics.</p><p>Here’s an example: In the late 1990’s, a study was conducted in a British supermarket. Over a two-week period, German and French music were played from a display featuring German and French wines. On the days German music was played, 73% of wine that was sold was German. On French music days, 77% of the wine sold was French. That means that if you were at that supermarket during their test buying wine, you were 3 to 4 times more likely to purchase wine that matched the music. While the music’s influence on the buyer’s behavior was enormous, 86% of the participants said that the tunes had no effect on them. This is a prime example of supraliminal messaging—the external stimulus was able to be detected, and there was a behavioral effect to boot.</p><p>Another example of supraliminal messaging that many have called “subliminal” is a 2008 ad for the KFC snacker chicken sandwich. About 25 seconds into the ad, the video cuts to the sandwich. For just a brief moment, hidden among the green leafy lettuce, is a one dollar bill. It was very fast, but still, many people caught it and public hysteria ensued. There were conspiracy theories, blog posts, and passionate groups ranting about KFC sending us all subliminal messages about their inexpensive sandwiches. Not long after the release of the ad, a blog post on the Chicago Tribune website stated that it was a publicity stunt rewarding those who saw the hidden bill with a free sandwich. Regardless, this was a supraliminal message that elicited a response—mission accomplished.</p><p>Of course, hidden messaging finds its way into packaging. There are loads of examples, but here are a few from some brands you might encounter on a semi-regular basis. Toblerone, the famous triangular Swiss chocolate treat, is from Bern, Switzerland. Bern, Switzerland sits in the shadow of Matterhorn Mountain, and the city is also known as the “City of Bears.” So right there, for all to see (if you look closely), one can find the roots of the company hidden cleverly in their logo. Additionally, there’s no doubt you have received a package from Amazon, and you likely noticed that the arrow makes a smile. But did you notice that the arrow is pointing from A to Z? Reminding consumers of the wide range of products one can find at Amazon?</p><p>Well—now you know—and when it comes to hidden messaging, knowing is half the battle!</p><p>Ready to learn more about human factors in packaging design?

This is where packaging comes in—this omnipresent industry is on the rise, and there are numerous career paths perfect for aspiring alum.</p><p>We put together a list of packaging careers based on collegiate majors to show how anyone can find their niche within the industry, and how the Packaging School can be the resource needed to make it a reality!</p><p><strong>1. Engineering Majors</strong></p><p>As an alum of an engineering program, you’ve got some serious industry knowledge under your belt already. There are plenty of open positions as a packaging engineer, where you’ll analyze the structural design of a package to give it a solid foundation that will hold up during various forms of testing. From checking prototypes to ensuring there are effective shipping methods in place, you’ll be able to apply what you’ve learned in your undergraduate course while getting hands-on experience.</p><p><strong>2. Art Majors</strong></p><p>For all of the creative, out-of-the-box thinkers with an artistic eye, a packaging design career is an ideal fit. Remember those graphic design courses that involved countless projects using computer-aided design? Well, now you can begin to build your professional portfolio by creating the latest and greatest eye-catching packaging designs. Apply what you’ve learned about artistic principles, like color theory, and turn design concepts into final products that make their way to shelves in a retail space.</p><p><strong>3. Psychology Majors</strong></p><p>You might be wondering how packaging relates to psychology, of all things. This is exactly what a consumer behavior analyst relies on to study, research, and analyze consumer trends. With this type of role, you can expect to utilize the fascinating theories discussed in your textbooks and predict future trends. Or help the brand stakeholders understand why the focus group chose the package with the nature theme due to the Biophilia Hypothesis. Packaging plays an important, psychological role in a consumer’s purchasing decisions, making the consumer behavior analyst an essential part of the team.</p><p><strong>4. Business Majors</strong></p><p>From professional selling courses to marketing management, graduates from a business program certainly have a place in the world of packaging. Of the countless, innovative packaging solutions being created, there are just as many openings for representatives to market and sell those products. As an account manager, you can expect to learn the ins and outs of a package design, making you an expert on the features and benefits. It’s your goal to showcase these advantages by cultivating relationships that will help the product land in the hands of those who need it.</p><p><strong>5. Law Majors</strong></p><p>When we said there was a place for everyone in packaging, we meant it! Packaging companies aren’t exempt from regulations; in fact, they must meet specific requirements regarding safety, manufacturing, distribution, and more. A packaging compliance specialist is responsible for ensuring all required laws are properly followed at all times. Law graduates can expect to apply their exceptional ability to keep up with the policies by communicating when changes need to be implemented.</p><p>So, if you’re entering the workforce for the first time, an awesome way to get your foot in the packaging industry is to get a certification. This way, you’ll be a standout candidate in addition to your newly achieved degree. The Packaging School offers a conveniently self-paced program to show you the ropes (and boost your resumé).</p><p>Learn more about the vast packaging industry in our online <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-foundations">Packaging Foundations Course</a>.</p>',

      '<p>Constancy, in relation to perception, is the brain’s tendency to sense objects as unchanging, regardless of changes to sensory input. Size constancy says that the size of objects is perceived to be constant, even though a change in the distance makes objects appear smaller or larger.</p><p>A good example of this is when you’re driving towards a city on a relatively flat interstate approaching a city. As you near the city, the buildings appear to get bigger and bigger like they are growing (top-down processing). We know the city is not growing, but perceptually they are growing (bottom-up processing).</p><p>Brightness constancy means the brightness of objects is perceived to be constant, even though changes in illumination make the objects appear brighter or darker. This same thing happens with brightness. A painting in a dark room looks different than the same painting in a bright room. </p><p>In the same vein, a recent grad student did a study on direct print onto a kraft brown board and compared eye-tracking and consumer attention to the same graphics printed on a premium coated board. Though there are clear differences in color and brightness, consumers shopped and viewed these packages the exact same way. It is always worth testing changes . . . but in this instance, the gestalt psychology principle reigned supreme—consumers did not change how they behaved and shopped this product. Since the price difference in premium vs. commodity materials is rather large, cost should be the driving factor here since there was no effect on shopper behavior when printing on the kraft board.</p><p>This is an important concept that should be considered and applied when it comes to packaging design.

In our talk, we explore their study on the effectiveness of packaging for cereal products.</p><p>Shannon and Package InSight utilized eye-tracking technology to gauge the importance of packaging for cereal. To do so, they had folks wear eye-tracking glasses to look at cereal in plain bags (with no outer packaging) and then cereal in the boxes themselves.</p><p>Read more on the results of the study <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packageinsight.com/breakfast-cereal/">here</a>!

      '<p><strong>Why is unboxing so popular? </strong><br>In this episode of the Packaging School Show, Episode 24, we take a look at the phenomenon of unboxing videos!<br><br>To do so, we start with our own attempt at unboxing a product we received from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://neurogum.com/">Nuero</a>. Nuero is a "functional gum &amp; mints" company with a product line enhancing everything from restful sleep to energy and focus. They sent us a box of goods for this video to help us explore the unboxing experience and its impact on consumer perception.</p><p>Nuero\'s box included an informational brochure, a business card, a sticker, two packs of gum, and a pack of energy mints. The components were packaged in a small corrugated box that included Nuero branding.</p><p>The search term "Unboxing" is one of the most popular on YouTube, and part of the appeal of unboxing videos is that they offer us a way to feel part of a celebration, almost like Christmas morning! The unboxing experience is heavily related to the experience of opening a present. It is no longer good enough to ensure the safe delivery of a product, brands must craft an unboxing experience in order to connect with consumers, especially in this eCommerce age. Brands like Nuero are finding ways to meet this consumer expectation.</p><p>Learn more about the phenomenon of "Unboxing" and see other examples of brands who tell a story with their packaging at our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/jCK0ZvWLRRs?si=sUv1swdakJ9OAaxm">YouTube Channel</a>.</p><p>Learn more about packaging design and it\'s impact on the consumer in our online packaging design courses at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/all_courses#courses">https://packagingschool.com/all_courses#courses</a></p>',

      '<p>Designing encompasses many different elements, but not all creations contain every element of design. It’s the purposeful choice of including or excluding an element that creates a design. There are also many considerations that go into designs. The elements of design are called design principles. Let’s look at a few design principles: emphasis, lines &amp; shapes, texture, and contrast.</p><p>Emphasis can be created in many different ways, but it tends to be created alongside other principles. You can see the difference between Tropicana’s old packaging versus its redesign. The new package deemphasized the brand and put emphasis on the 100% orange. Tropicana’s redesign was one of the best-known branding disasters and they soon returned to their old packaging.</p><p>Lines and shapes are also important to design. All objects in designs are created through lines and shapes—they can be inconsistent and uncomplimentary or sleek and minimal. </p><p>Texture is used in many designs. Different textures can be created by various substrates, printing methods, or embossing. Unusual texture can attract the eye or even redirect the eye to a different element. A good example is Kraft paper which can be used to create a natural, recyclable feel to a product.</p><p>Contrast can be created in multiple ways by using different colors, shapes, and sizes. Color contrast with a dark background color and a bright yellow or white image adds depth and definition. Typography contrast can be used as well. Different fonts can be tied together with a common color scheme and, if done correctly, can provide just the right touch.</p><p>As you can see, there are many principles to artwork and design that must be taken into consideration to design and print a package that is attractive and compelling. The proper use of these principles in package design will result in a package that draws the consumer to take a closer look.</p><p>Learn more about package printing at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-printing">https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-printing</a></p>',

      "<p>Paperboard is one of the most popular packaging formats in retail grocery. It's your silent salesperson, your first brand and product impression, the primary vehicle for consumer use, and it influences shopper behavior and decision making. But when you get down to the details, there are many differences from board to board. And when you talk with paperboard vendors, you'll notice significant price fluctuations and options across paperboard.</p><p>So how do we gain certainty when designing with paperboard? An educated packaging scientist understands grades of paperboard. Understanding paperboard grades is essential. Each grade features different strengths. Most importantly, grades can fluctuate in price by up to 50%. The purpose of this lecture is to introduce you to the six most common grades, their properties, and applications you'll find in the marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>So, let's get into it.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"font-bold\">1. SBS</h3><p>Let's start with solid bleached sulfate. The word sulfate comes from the chemical used in the kraft pulping process. It's made from virgin hardwood—premium—and usually has a mineral or a synthetic coating on the top and reverse sides. It's approved for direct food contact. The best grade for surface consistency. It has the best printability, better than average diecutting and foldability, and works well in frozen applications. It's also fairly strong. SBS is sanitary and the ideal substrate to use in aromatic products like fine teas. SBS is the most expensive substrate and is widely available in North America, Canada, and Nordic countries. You'll find SBS frequently in the average US grocery market.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"font-bold\">2. SUS</h3><p>So take those one hundred percent virgin fibers, hold the bleach, and apply a thick printable coating to one side, and you have SUS—solid unbleached sulfate. Now, this grade is popular. It's less expensive than SBS. It's the strongest of all the grades, and it's naturally resistant to moisture. And when enhanced with some coatings, it's a winner in the fridge and freezer. You'll see SUS in many applications, but most certainly as a beverage holder. You’ve got some heavy glass bottles and paperboard in a wet environment? Better use SUS. This grade goes by many names. WestRock registered the name CNK, which is coated natural kraft. It is also called CUK—coated unbleached kraft. Whatever the name, the composition is the same.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"font-bold\">3. UUK</h3><p>So the next grade is UUK. Everything we've discussed so far—SBS and SUS—are usually made from virgin hardwood fibers, and that's expensive.</p><p>UUK is a natural grade. Both sides are brown and usually made from a blend of softwood like pine trees and hardwood. UUK may contain recycled fibers as well. The benefit of UUK is that you get a high strength at a lower cost, but if you want a crisp and bright print application, you're not gonna see that with UUK.</p><p>UUK is a popular choice for heavy duty items, hardware, and even wet environments where crisp print and high cost are not really desired. You may see a 30 to 40% discount on UUK compared to SBS, so it's worthy of your consideration.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"font-bold\">4. CRB</h3><p>So do you need a non-food contact, versatile board with a hundred percent recycled content? Then you need some CRB—coated recycled board, a.k.a. CCN, a.k.a. CCNB, a.k.a. Duplex, a.k.a. WLC, a.k.a. GB. Phew.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot of variation to this grade and it's fairly low strength. But if you have a low weight item like a bag of cereal, chips, or snacks, you'll find CRB an ideal choice.</p><h3 class=\"font-bold\">5. URB</h3><p>So do you have a need for a paperboard that isn't in plain view like a setup box or dividers? So a setup box would have a wrap around it and a coating. You can see there a material like that, or in terms of a divider, a material like this where you don't really see it, but it absolutely has a function for it. I mean, let's be honest, we don't wanna pay a lot for this. So URB—uncoated recycled board—is your pick by far. URB is the least expensive paperboard grade and most likely provides the highest value when you need it.</p><h3 class=\"font-bold\">6. FBB</h3><p>So I've saved the most interesting paperboard grade for last—FBB—folding box board. FBB is a multi-ply grade and is made up of one or more mechanically pulp layers leveraging strength. It's sandwiched between two layers of chemical pulp, which leverages printability, smoothness, and brightness. So it's the best of both worlds. Compared to SBS, you'll sacrifice strength, but you'll gain in usability. Depending on coatings and composition, you'll see highend FBB priced competitively with SBS and up to 35% less cost for more economical grades.</p><p>One thing about FBB that I think is cool is that it opens and closes so nicely—and you're not gonna see a lot of creasing and damage to your scores. It also makes a lot of sense if you're gonna be opening and closing a lot of things, and it can take a lot of premium enhancements. You can see the gloss on here. There's a nice emboss on this bandaid. It's engineered to be a great card.</p><p>The goal of this lecture was to raise your awareness of the most common paperboard grades, and if you're a student of the Packaging School, you'll have access to this incredibly awesome cheat sheet that summarizes everything we've talked about plus a bunch more for quick and easy reference.</p><p>Remember, packaging is a science—learn, evaluate, and test before you buy. Request samples from your vendors because they're usually free.</p>",

      '<p>How will the printing industry evolve in the foreseeable future? The printing industry is forecasted to reach a market value of $600 billion in 2020. Based on this number, there is a clear future for all areas of the printing process. Let’s take a look at where all the major printing methods are headed!</p><p>Currently, we are in a revival of the letterpress. The wedding industry has many couples using letterpress for their wedding invitations, and this trend looks to continue as more people explore letterpress for special projects such as invitations, business cards, and coasters. An increasing number of Americans are seeking an escape from the impersonal and chaotic use of the web. They are seeking out the old methods in an effort to feel more connected to their work, and letterpress fits the bill.</p><p>In 2013, packaging was the largest segment of Flexographic printing at 80% due to the quick drying process across many different substrates. However, interest in flexo is decreasing as digital begins to handle more substrates and increase print speeds. Flexo is experiencing reductions in run lengths. There is significant development in the pre-production stage, improving quality while reducing costs due to the lengthy artwork approval process. Still, experts predict that advancements in plates, anilox rollers, inks, plate mounting, and curing ink will continue to make this process the most widely used printing method for packaging. Most new flexo presses are driven by servo motors which results in less vibration than the shaft driven designs. Less vibration means print quality is improved.</p><p style="text-align: start">Lithography fulfills the need for flexibility among varying substrates, but it is decreasing for short, full color runs. It is predicted to have fully programmed routines for start-up and close, with full monitoring of all impressions. Presses will progressively have even more availability for coaters, foiling, glue application, die-cutting, and inkjet number / coding systems. Though print volume may decrease by 10%, it will still remain a viable part of the printing industry.</p><p style="text-align: start">Gravure printing has lost 5% of market share in publishing, since it is efficient only for extremely long runs. Due to the expense and time needed to get a press running, interest in gravure printing continues to decrease. Advancements have been made in gravure printing for shorter runs that could keep interest in gravure stable, but this is unlikely.</p><p style="text-align: start">Screen printing offers one of the thickest ink layers, unprecedented by any other printing process, causing a growth in this form of printing. Screen printing will move from manual machines to semi-automatic and automatic machines in the future, further increasing the demand. However, screen printing is unable to increase productivity even with the addition of automation aids and digital control.</p><p style="text-align: start">In 2015, digital print accounted for 13.9% of all print and printed packaging in value terms, but just 2.5% of total world volume. The transition from offset to digital printing is accelerating. In 2020, digital will account for 17.4% of value and 3.4% of all print and printed packaging volume. In 2013, market value of digital was at $120.9 billion – total market in 2024 is predicted to be 225% of that value, putting it at about $272 billion. Digital has won a large share of the sleeve and label business, and will continue to make significant headway in the corrugated, cartons, flexible packaging, and metal industries. There will also be more customizable options available as digital printing increases.</p><p style="text-align: start">With the rise of 3D printing, we should see faster product innovation because concept to design to prototype time is decreased. 3D medical implants, such as prosthetics, orthodontic devices, and possibly veins and arteries become a possibility in the realm of 3D printing. More products, such as hearing aids, will be able to be customized.</p><p style="text-align: start">Future trends for all print processes include the use of environmentally friendly inks and sustainable inking methods. You can also expect faster printing processes as technology advances. It will be exciting to see where the world of print takes us in the future!</p><p style="text-align: start">Check out our<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/courses/packaging-printing">Package Printing</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>course for more!<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)">&nbsp;</span></p>',

      '<p>Sam, a senior graphic design student—from a school the Packaging School is not affiliated with—came to our office recently asking for support on his capstone project. The task was to create a branded package, so he came with a visual design for a paperboard packaging concept that he created on a digital art file. While guiding him through the process of creating a physical printed and converted sample, we learned the following about this soon-to-be-employed college senior:</p><ul><li><p>He was unaware of how to organize design elements within their appropriate layers and how to properly construct a dieline.</p></li><li><p>He lacked a working vocabulary of packaging production terminology (score, crease, registration, etc.).</p></li><li><p>He was confused about how the 2D design ultimately converted to a 3D package. His confusion began at the digital level and extended through the physical blank crafted on a sample table.</p></li></ul><p>Sam graduated a week later from an accredited program with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was a smart kid and, based on our interaction with him, a good designer. However, he had no practical knowledge of packaging design or prototyping. This story may sound familiar to you; you have a need for a new entry-level designer (graphic and/or structural), so you hire someone out of a design-focused program, only to find they are not prepared to hit the ground running within your packaging workflow.</p><p>It’s not that this designer was a slacker in the classroom — quite the contrary. It’s not unusual for super-smart folks to find it difficult to translate theory or great ideas into real applications without applied training — a paradox commonly referred to as the “Valley of Death.” Many companies face these obstacles within their own internal development processes, and it is the case for much of corporate research and development. Theories may be clearly understood on paper, but the bridge doesn’t always exist when it’s time to apply it in practice.</p><p>Sam, upon wrapping up four years of design theory, found himself in that Valley of Death without the applied technical training or experience to bridge his classroom lessons and the workplace. So, the team here at Packaging School took it upon ourselves to give him a few last lessons before he headed out into the big world. In just a few hours, we taught him crucial practices, like how to create production-ready digital files or communicate his needs to a local printer. We showed him the difference between paperboard types, how those same digital files translated to a sampling table, and how to convert his flat cut-and-creased dieline into a 3D package. They were all steps in the process that he didn’t even know existed.</p><p>At<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/">PackagingSchool.com</a>, we create onboarding education for new employees like Sam, showing them how to translate theories into practical packaging applications and provide them with confidence to be effective and powerful employees right out of the gate.</p><p>It’s not just new hires who find themselves on the wrong side of the valley.

For you, that may mean incorporating updated technology and new operations into their day-to-day workflow or giving them the creative means to brush up on existing processes and policies to ensure consistent achievement for your business.</p><p>Is it time to rejuvenate your training program?<span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://packagingschool.com/">PackagingSchool.com</a><span style="color: rgb(100, 116, 139)"> </span>already offers an extensive library of courses guaranteed to bridge the knowledge gap for new employees and seasoned veterans.

HB 1326 would work to establish the <em>Hawaii Zero Waste Initiative</em>, a program including the establishment of a Packaging Waste Advisory council which would be responsible for creating a PRO.</p><p>HB 1326 also includes a requirement for the Department of Health to lead a study to understand “the resources required to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=1326&amp;year=2023">reduce packaging waste by 70% from the baseline amount by 2035</a>.” The proposed bill has long term plans for an EPR program in Hawaii and relies on a PRO system like current EPR legislation that has passed in the United States thus far.&nbsp;</p><p>Going up against HB 1326 is the fund-based <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=1458&amp;year=2023">SB 1458</a>, which was also introduced January 25th, 2023. Unlike HB 1326, SB1458 does not include the creation of a PRO and instead requires top packaging producers, defined by the law, to pay an annual fee into an <em>Extender Producer Responsibility Special Fund </em>that has a 5-year timeline.</p><p>The proceeds collected from the special fund will be used for packaging and waste reduction programs organized at the county level. Hawaii officials are currently evaluating which of the two proposed bills aligns more with the island states unique waste management needs; as of April 2023, both bills are currently stalled and awaiting further action. However, we anticipate that one of these two bills will become Hawaii’s EPR program in the near future.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Illinois – </strong>HB 2874</h3><p>In February of this year, Representative Dagmara Avelar introduced the proposed <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2874&amp;GAID=17&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=148006&amp;SessionID=112&amp;GA=103">Packaging and Paper Products Stewardship Act</a> for the state of Illinois. HB 2874, like Hawaii’s HB 1326, relies on the establishment of a PRO to ensure the program\'s success.</p><p>The proposed act also requires identified producers to work with the advisory committee of the act to “publish a list of minimum types of readily recyclable materials based on available collection and processing infrastructure and recycling markets for covered materials.”</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2874&amp;GAID=17&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=148006&amp;SessionID=112&amp;GA=103">HB 2874</a> also requires packaging and paper products producers to create and manage waste prevention and reuse systems, including composting and consumer education programs.</p><p>The last action related to the act was its re-referral to the <em>Rules Committee </em>on March 27th of this year.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Massachusetts – </strong>H.799&nbsp;</h3><p>In section 2 of the proposed <em>An Act to save recycling costs in the commonwealth </em>(<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H779/BillHistory">H.799</a>), Representative Michael S. Day lays out a plan for an EPR-adjacent program for the state of Massachusetts. Section 2 of the 36-page act is titled, <em>Packaging Reduction and Recycling Program</em>.</p><p>This program includes a fee structure for producers who operated in the state and the power for the state to require packaging producers to change packaging designs to align with the acts provisions. Instead of titling it a “producer responsibility organization,”</p><p>H.799 establishes a <em>Packaging Reduction Organization </em>which is responsible for the collection of “packaging reduction, generation, and recycling information and fee payments.” The proposed act is comprehensive and includes a State Comptroller audit each year to ensure efficacy.</p><p>The last action related to H.799 was a joint hearing on June 14th of this year and its referral to the <em>Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources</em>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>New Jersey – </strong>S426</h3><p>On January 11, 2022, Senators Bob Smith and Richard Codey introduced a proposed act for New Jersey titled the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/S426/bill-text?f=S0500&amp;n=426_I1">Packaging Product Stewardship Act</a> (S426).</p><p>The proposed S426 works to require “producers of packaging products sold in New Jersey to adopt and implement packaging product stewardship plans.” The use of a required <em>Packaging Product Stewardship Plan</em> calls on producers of packaging in the state of New Jersey to work individually or as a group to draft a plan that focuses on the management, collection, reuse, and disposal of packaging products in the state and encouraging PCR content in packaging products.</p><p>The act defines the term “Packaging Product” as “any product or material that is designed and used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery, or presentation of another product, including, but not limited to, a food or beverage item, that is sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in the State.”</p><p>The proposed act has been dormant since its introduction in early 2022, however, as other states act, like New Jersey’s neighbor, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.wastedive.com/news/maryland-governor-signs-epr-organics-and-electric-vehicle-laws/649929/">Maryland</a>, recently did in May of this year, it could encourage the Garden state to bring S426 back to the table.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>New York – </strong>SB S1064</h3><p>On January 9th of this year, New York State Senator Rachel May introduced <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S1064#:~:text=2023%2DS1064%20(ACTIVE)%20%2D%20Summary,establishes%20the%20packaging%20responsibility%20fund.">SB S1064</a>.</p><p>SB S1064 is titled the <em>Extended Producer Responsibility Program for Packaging</em> and requires producers of packaging in the state to create and manage the implementation of a <em>Producer Responsibility Program Plan </em>(either solo or collectively) which includes “a list of the types and brands of packaging products included in the plan; the methods by which the producer will achieve minimum post-consumer content rates, recovery rates and recycling rate” and more.</p><p>Similar to Illinois, the proposed bill includes a PRO-adjacent system with a different title. The latest action related to SB S1064 is its referral to the <em>Environmental Conservation Committee </em>in January of this year.</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>North Carolina – </strong>HB 279</h3><p>On March 6th of this year, Representatives Butler and Harrison introduced <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookup/2023/H279">HB 279</a> to the General Assembly of North Carolina. HB 279 is titled <em>An Act to Establish Extended Producer Responsibility for Certain Producers of Products Using Packaging Materials and to Ban the Manufacture and Distribution of Packaging Materials Containing Certain Toxic Substances in Order to Protect Public Health</em>.</p><p>The act calls for all registered “Responsible Producers” to join or establish a <em>Producer Responsibility Organization </em>that operates as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The PROs are responsible for drafting and seeking approval of “Stewardship Plans.” The proposed legislation also lays out requirements for “Non-Reusable Packaging Reduction”—including a reduction of 40% of material 8 years after approval of a stewardship plan.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookup/2023/H279">latest action</a> related to HB 279 was its referral to the <em>Commission on Rules, Calendar, and Operations Committee</em> on March 7th of this year.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Rhode Island – </strong>SB 200</h3><p>Numerous Rhode Island state Senators, including the likes of Senator Valverde and Senator Gu, introduced <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText23/SenateText23/S0200.pdf">SB 200</a> on February 16th, 2023.</p><p>The proposed act is titled, <em>An Act Relating to Health and Safety </em>-- <em>Extended Producer Responsibility for Packaging. </em>SB 200 calls for the General Assembly of Rhode Island to add a chapter, <em>Chapter 99</em>, to SECTION 1. Title 23 of the General Laws Entitled “HEALTH AND SAFETY.”</p><p>The proposed chapter works to establish a <em>Packaging Reduction and Recycling Program </em>in which identified packaging producers will pay a fee based on the quantity and type of packaging materials produced, distributed, or sold into the state.</p><p>The structure of the act is similar to that of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/H779/BillHistory">Massachusetts’s H.799</a>, in which the state establishes a non-profit organization to organize and manage the collection of fees and information related to “packaging reduction, generation, and recycling.”</p><p>The latest action related to SB 200 was its referral to the <em>Environment and Agriculture Committee</em>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Tennessee – </strong>HB 0550&nbsp;</h3><p>On January 25th of this year, Tennessee state Senator Heidi Cambell introduced a proposed act called the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0550&amp;ga=113#:~:text=Recycling%20%2D%20As%20introduced%2C%20enacts%20the,Title%2067%20and%20Title%2068.">Tennessee Waste Reduction and Recycling Act</a>, HB 0550.</p><p>The act, similar to others, calls for identified packaging producers to establish PROs to reduce packaging waste and enhance statewide recycling systems.</p><p>The proposed HB 0550 (also SB573) also calls for the appointment of a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/tn-bill-aims-to-cut-packaging-waste-fund-recycling/">Producer Responsibility Advisory Board</a>, consisting of 13 members across various stakeholder groups to be appointed by the <em>Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation </em>(TDEC).</p><p>One of the main motivations behind the bill is to boost in-state recycling systems, as a survey conducted by the TDEC in 2018 revealed that <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/state-tennessees-circular-economy">41% of the 300 industries surveyed have their materials recycled outside of the state</a>.</p><p>The latest action related to HB 0550 was sponsors being added on March 9th of this year.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-bold"><strong>Washington – </strong>HB 1131</h3><p>On January 5th, 2023, numerous representatives introduced <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1131&amp;Year=2023"><em>An Act Relating to Improving Washington\'s Solid Waste Management Outcomes</em></a> (HB 1131).
